<p>Let's begin our Nimzo-Indian journey by seeing what happens if White attacks the bishop straightaway:</p>

is known as the Saemisch Variation. Instead of ignoring the bishop on b4, White immediately forces Black to exchange it for the knight. This is certainly quite a radical solution. White uses up a move (a2-a3), one he could otherwise have spent on developing, to force Black to do something he's quite happy to do - inflict White with doubled c-pawns. The advantage from White's point of view is that at least the situation is resolved quickly and he can now focus on other goals. Nevertheless, the Saemisch Variation isn't seen as a major threat to the Nimzo-Indian and isn't hugely popular at the moment.</p>
<p class="warning message">QUESTION: Then why begin with the Saemisch?</p>
<p class="notification message">ANSWER: In one way the Saemisch could still be viewed as a critical test of the Nimzo-Indian. White is basically questioning Black's whole opening strategy. He thinks so little of Black's "threat" to take on c3 he is willing to expend a whole move to force Black to carry it out!</p>
<p>Furthermore, I feel that studying the sharp imbalanced positions which the Saemisch Variation provides is a good starting point, and also a basic testing ground for would-be Nimzo-Indian players. If you don't enjoy the positions where you are fighting against the doubled c-pawns, it's possible that the Nimzo-Indian is simply not the opening for you. Equally, it's exactly these types of position which initially attract many players to the opening.</p>
<p>Black has a number of good ways of playing against the Saemisch. For this book I've chosen to study

, which I feel is the most principled and perhaps the most ambitious way for Black to start the fight against the doubled pawns. Before I give anything more away, let's move on to the first game!</p>

, a key Nimzo-Indian move:</p>
<p>1. It fixes the c4-pawn, although at the moment the pin on the d3-bishop was enough to do this.</p>
<p>2. It gives Black more space in which to operate on the queenside.</p>
<p>3. It allows Black to exert more pressure on c4 with <b>...Qc7</b> and <b>...Rc8</b>.</p>
<p>4. It attack's White's centre: the d4-pawn and, less directly, the e5-pawn.</p>
<p>5. White is given the chance to play dxc5 if the right opportunity arises. If the position opens up, his two bishops could benefit.</p>
<p>6. Black's dark squares, in particular d6, have been weakened.</p>
<p>Black always needs to keep these considerations in mind when deciding whether or not to play ...c5. In this particular instance, I would say the positives heavily outweigh the negatives.</p>

<p>Brodsky's little queen move has devastating consequences. White can no longer hold on to the c4-pawn. Because White's whole strategy has been to protect c4 before trying anything active, once the c4-pawn does go his position falls apart – he is too passively placed to expect any real compensation.</p>

In the space of a few moves, Black has seriously weakened his dark squares by playing both <b>...c5</b> and <b>...g5</b>. I'm not saying that this position is necessarily bad for Black, only that it compares unfavourably with, for example, the <b>...c5</b> plan seen in our previous game.;</p>

<p>This move is dual-purpose:</p>
<p>1. It takes the sting out of <b>e4-e5</b> – Black can now simply move the knight rather than play <b>...g5</b>.</p>

<p class="warning message">QUESTION: Black is always taking on c4 with the bishop rather than the knight. Why is this so?</p>
<p class="notification message">ANSWER: Occasionally Black takes on c4 with the knight, but generally the bishop capture is better, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1 <b>...Bxc4</b> usually leads to an exchange of light-squared bishops, removing one of White's bishop pair and accentuating Black's control of the light squares, and of c4 in particular;</p>
<p>2. The knight is the piece which benefits most from the c4-outpost, and after an exchange of bishops the c4-square becomes available to the knight; and, perhaps most importantly</p>
<p>3. <b>...Nxc4</b> often puts Black in an awkward self-pin, with the knight being unable to move without exposing the a6-bishop.</p>

<p class="warning message">QUESTION: Isn't this move a little slow? If White's most promising plan is to advance in the centre, surely he should be trying to play <b>e2-e4</b> in one go?</p>
<p class="notification message">ANSWER: It would make sense, but actually it's not quite a simplistic as that.</p>
<p>For example, let's see what might happen if Black continues with the normal plan:
 <span onclick='loadMove("rn1qk2r/p1pp1ppp/bp2pn2/8/2PP4/P1P1P3/5PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7", this, "c8a6"); ' class="line2">6...Ba6</span>

and we have reached a familiar position (from Labensky-Brodsky) except White's f-pawn is back on f2 rather than f3. Paradoxically, this "missing" tempo actually favours White, because after
 <span onclick='loadMove("r2qk2r/p1pp1ppp/bp2pn2/n3P3/2PP4/P1PB4/5PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 9", this, "e4e5"); ' class="line2">9.e5!</span>

there's no pawn to block the queen, and

is strong.</p>

<p>Black is forced to make an undesirable concession here with either

. It's worth remembering that the role of f2-f3 is to force through e2-e4, but the pawn itself is of limited value on f3 and sometimes even a hindrance!
</p>
<p>In view of this variation, Black's most accurate move is probably
 <span onclick='loadMove("rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/P1P1P3/5PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7", this, "c8b7"); ' class="line2">6...Bb7</span>

<p>1. Because White has played <b>e2-e3</b> - instead of <b>f2-f3</b> and <b>e2-e4</b> - his progress advancing in the centre is delayed.</p>
<p>2. Black is already committed to castling kingside, something he usually delays or even avoids in the

<p>As we saw in the notes to Moskalenko-Neverov (Game 3), if White chooses e3 and Bd3 instead of f3 and e4, a certain amount of flexibility is beneficial to Black. In the long run the bishop may end up on a6. However, for the moment on b7 it prevents e4 for at least one further move and it forces White to act over the threat of <b>...Bxg2</b>.</p>

<p>Compared to the normal Saemisch set-up, White has been able to develop much more aggressively, with the knight on its most active square (instead of a pawn!). This means there is much greater danger to Black's kingside than normal. Indeed, there is already a significant threat, which Black failed to spot in the following game:

<p class="warning message">QUESTION: Should Black accept the pawn offer?</p>
<p class="notification message">ANSWER: I feel that he should, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. White definitely gains some compensation (e.g. open g-file, time), but this is definitely a "real sacrifice", and as such there's a degree of speculation.</p>
<p>2. Just as importantly, if Black declines to take the pawn he accepts a concession in that White will most likely be able to achieve e4 without having to play f3
(e.g. after

prevents the pin, but it also possesses other qualities:</p>
<p>1. The sting is drawn from e4-e5, as it no longer arrives with a threat.</p>
<p>2. The knight might later go to d6, where it increases the pressure on the c4 weakness.</p>
<p>3. Black's f-pawn is free to advance, either to hold up White's attack or to strike in the centre with <b>...f5</b>.</p>

<h3>Key Notes</h3>
<p>1. A swift attack on the c4-pawn is a major plan for Black in the Saemisch. The most direct way to start the attack is by <b>...b6</b>, <b>...Ba6</b> and <b>...Nc6-a5</b>. Further pressure can often be applied by <b>...Qd7-a4</b> (after <b>...d6</b>), or by <b>...c5</b> followed by <b>...Rc8</b> or <b>...Qc7</b>.</p>
<p>2. Both players should recognize that the Saemisch is basically a type of a gambit. White accepts a major weakness in his pawn structure, leading to a possible loss of a pawn, in return for advantages such as an imposing pawn centre. Those playing Black must recognize that capturing the c4-pawn is sometimes only the beginning of the battle. Equally, White players must realize that it's often unwise to grimly hang on to the c4-pawn, especially at the expense of active possibilities elsewhere (see Labensky-Brodsky (Game 1), for example).</p>
<p>3. If Black wins the c4-pawn, or even if it is exchanged, afterwards the c4-square frequently becomes a vital outpost. It can be a particular effective outpost for a black knight (see Labensky-Brodsky, Game 1).</p>
<p>4. Black must be ready to meet an early attack on the f6-knight with e4-e5 when, depending on the specific circumstances, the knight goes to either g8 or h5. In Labensky-Brodsky (Game 1) and Moskalenko-Neverov (Game 3), the best option was back to g8, whereas in Yang-Ippolito (Game 2) it was to h5.</p>
<p>5. Due to the absence of Black's dark-squared bishop, <b>Bg5</b> becomes an important idea for White, especially in conjunction with <b>e4-e5</b>. Black often combats this with either <b>...h6</b> and <b>...g5</b> or by breaking the pin with <b>...Qc8</b> (which also intends <b>...Qb7-c6</b>). In view of the potential danger caused by <b>Bg5</b>, Black usually delays castling kingside and often avoids it altogether.</p>
<p>6. In the delayed Saemisch with <b>4.e3 0-0 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3</b>, Black's king is already committed to the kingside. To combat the threat of <b>Bg5</b> after <b>e3-e4</b>, Black plays the key move <b>...Ne8!</b> which prevents the pin, draws the sting from the e5 advance and also allows the knight the possibility to join the attack on c4 via d6.</p>
