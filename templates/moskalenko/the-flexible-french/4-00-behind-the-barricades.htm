variation in the French Defence was the well-known Polish master Szymon Winawer (1838-1920). He defended from both sides of the barricades, playing this line both as White and as Black.</p>
<p>Another specialist in the French Defence, and the author of My System, Aaron Nimzowitsch (1886-1935), was one of the strongest dogmatic chess players of his time. Both in his games and his concepts, he preferred using one colour or the other: White or Black, but not both.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another main character of that period of chess history, the fourth World Champion Alexander Alekhine (1892-1946), often liked to play openings with both colours and he made investigations beyond dogmas and general rules.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the main debate has carried on until the present day, only the protagonists have changed. This clash of concepts will be the key subject of Part Four, where we will learn how to play using 'both colours' in the Winawer Variation of the French Defence.</p>
<h3>Ideas</h3>
<p>The main ideas of the

pin are quite simple: attacking the centre and not wasting any tempi (as in the Classical Variation
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4", this, "g8f6"); ' class="line2">3...Nf6</span>

). In this way, the king's knight stays on its most flexible square: g8. In the event of <b>...Bb4xNc3-bxc3</b> Black will obtain a favourable pawn structure. The other bishop can be exchanged after <b>...b6</b> and <b>...Ba6</b>, or activated by manoeuvres such as <b>...Bd7-a4</b> or <b>...Bd7-e8-g6</b>. For his part, White must take advantage of his space advantage, the weakness created on g7 (with <b>Qg4!</b>), the mobility of his minor pieces, and also the attacking resources offered by the h-pawn with <b>h2-h4</b>.</p>

<p>In this Part we will investigate two directions:</p>
