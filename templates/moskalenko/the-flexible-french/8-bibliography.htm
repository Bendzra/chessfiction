<p>The famous French Defence is one of the most widely-played chess openings. It is a fighting opening, which perfectly suits many club players as well as a growing number of top players.</p>
<p>The Flexible French is a revolutionary repertoire book for both Black and White. Viktor Moskalenko presents a wealth of original and dynamic options in every main line, proving that the French is a very lively and intriguing defence.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian grandmaster's analysis is high-level, yet his touch is light and fresh, and the book sparkles with original ideas. In his own inimitable style, Moskalenko gives the reader new gusto for the French.</p>
<p>This extremely accessible book rounds off with seven relatively unknown weapons, early deviations with which you may surprise your opponent - as Black or as White!</p>
