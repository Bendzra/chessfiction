<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This book is based on games by contemporary players at the very highest level. The idea is based around a move-by-move approach to annotation, with the hope that players from all levels will be able to appreciate something of top-level chess.</p>
<p>Do not be excessively deterred at what might seem a long-winded approach, a dozen or more detailed pages over a single game. Chess is complicated. While writing up this book, I played through Sergey Shipov's annotations of Shirov-Aronian, Moscow 2006 (<a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/16-shirov-aronian.htm' %}">Game 16</a>), in New in Chess Magazine (2006, vol. 8, pp. 23-35). Shipov went through the first 22 moves at great speed, and commented that the players have reached 'another deep-water tabiya. The best analysts in the world began their analysis in positions which simple chess amateurs are not even capable of reaching.' Which is, of course, absolutely believable. The problem for the reader is that Shipov gives no analysis. This is understandable enough, since space is precious, and there is no room to go through moves which are already established and analysed. Where does this leave the reader, though? Half the content of the game has been dropped in the annotations, and the simple chess amateur has no chance of trying to understand what is going on. One of the main aims in this book is to try to bridge the gap in understanding between the amateur and the top players, which I suppose means I must regard myself as somewhere midpoint in this gap. It is up to the reader to decide how deeply, or how briefly, he or she would want to explore the opening. There is no obligation to try to plough through every variation.</p>
<p>There is also another reason, beyond the opening part of the game, why the analysis might seem long-winded. The point is that a top-level grandmaster when writing up games will tend to concentrate only on the most difficult positions, and will tend to ignore writing down what is seen as 'obvious'. The obvious points are, though, absolutely fundamental to good chess, and no top grandmaster will ignore them while playing a competitive game. A player may note that there is a simple back-row checkmate if he snatches a piece, and he will avoid this. It would seem hardly worthwhile to mention this elementary tactic while annotating, but the tactic is central to the game, and needs if possible to be mentioned.</p>
<p>Inevitably there will need to be some juggling when trying to annotate games which will be satisfactory both for stronger players and for the less-experienced player. My hope is that everyone will be able to gain something.</p>
<p>As time goes on in chess, analysis tends to become more complicated. The use of the computer means that an author is these days expected to cover long strings of analysis. There is no longer any excuse. Nowadays it will be easy enough for the reader to check, with the help of the computer, whether the author might be
<!--p>7</p--><!--p>Modern Chess: Move by Move</p-->
dodging critical lines. In the old days an author might give a one-move line in a complicated position, saying that 'White is better' or 'Black has compensation for the pawn', or whatever, and not much is gained. Perhaps before the computer, it would have taken a whole afternoon for the writer to try to work out what is going on, in even a relatively uncomplicated position, and it is often better to be more economical with the time. With the help of the computer, it is now possible to delve into any position or variation. This makes things both easier and more complicated. One can jump much higher, but the bar is also much higher. There is also the standard warning that the computer can make mistakes in interpreting a position. The best analysis is through the combination of the computer and human assessment. If pushed, I would argue that a conscientious human analyst without the use of the computer would still be preferable to the routine use of the computer.</p>
<p>It would be flattering if 2700+ players were to be interested in this book, but no doubt they will be able to show that I have misinterpreted parts of the game. Such is life. As the reader will be able to verify, there are 33 games in this book in which a 2600+ player has done something wrong, and lost. I cannot pretend that I too will not have made some extra errors, maybe serious. The hope of the annotator is always that new and good ideas will outweigh the introduction of extra errors. Of course, the audience would be extremely small if I were trying to write for the top 33 players. What guidance might there be for the much wider chess public?</p>
<p>Good and interesting chess games are always complicated. There is no way of avoiding this. The most complicated positions may take up two pages of analysis, to decide whether the grandmaster has in fact found the best move, or whether a mistake has been made. The cardinal rule of scientific chess theory is that if a player loses a game, he must have made a mistake somewhere. The conscientious chess writer is always extremely interested in trying to untangle where the decisive mistake has been made, and will also be worried about the possibility that a question mark is given, maybe by the author himself, maybe by other commentators, when the supposed error is in fact sound.</p>
<p>Much of the analysis in a game will concentrate on the technical point of whether any move is correct, or a mistake. This might seem boring and technical, but it is not. There is only such a small gap between a mistake and a brilliant move that it is a wonder that so few mistakes are made at higher levels. In a really complicated position, two amateur players may make half a dozen slips each, and one of them eventually wins, and the other player loses. It will still be a good and entertaining game, but a really top grandmaster will be able to guide his way through even the most mind-blowing positions, and will often be able to find a win after even the slightest of the opponent's mistakes. This is great chess, and vastly entertaining chess, at the highest level.</p>
<p>When playing though these games, it is probably best to skim through the games first time around. Cain the general features of the game, and then look at the position more closely next time. Take note of the careful thought behind the
<!--p>8</p--><!--p>Introduction</p-->
modern opening in chess, take note of the mistakes of the loser in each game, and also enjoy the creativity of chess.</p>

<h3>Some Points on the Chess Rating System</h3>
<p>We start with the final official tournament event of Carry Kasparov, Linares 2005. It is, of course, quite possible that he may decide that he will try a tournament or match at some subsequent event, but on the other hand, why bother? He has already made his mark in history, and this will never be forgotten for as long as chess is played. He now has other interests.</p>
<p>If we go back to the match when Kasparov beat Karpov to become World Champion in 1985, Kasparov's rating was 2700, and Karpov's 2720. These days, there are now more than 30 players who have reached 2700. There has been considerable speculation as to whether the ratings have been inflated to some extent. Certainly from playing through the current games, one feels the 2700 player is not quite as strong as Kasparov in 1985. This, however, is a relatively small gap. A guesstimate would be that Kasparov's 2700 at the beginning of the match would equate to about 2725 these days, and Karpov's 2720 would have been the equivalent to 2745 nowadays. Going through other players, Timman would probably have been equivalent of around 2700 at that time, but no-one else. We provide this merely as a base-mark.</p>
<p>Kasparov continued to improve considerably since 1985, and it was clear at the time that he was not yet at his peak. In Belgrade 1989 he won, three points ahead of Timman and Ehlvest, and rather more points ahead of other 2600+ opposition. His reward was to reach 2800 for the first time, for himself or for anyone.</p>
<p>Kasparov's rating dropped slightly, at various times during the 1990s, but then between 1997 and his retirement in 2005, his play was consistently over 2800. Other players, such as Anand, Kramnik and Topalov, have reached 2800, but have since dropped down again at some point. In early 2004, for example, both Anand and Kramnik had a frustrating 2799 rating score, while Topalov was 2780, although the Bulgarian is now back over 2800.</p>
<p>No player as yet has emulated Kasparov's achievement in keeping his rating over 2800 for a consistent length of time. We have many players now who would like to aspire to this challenge, but who will fully emulate it? Maybe one of the younger players? Who knows?</p>

<h3>The Games</h3>
<p>I wanted to write up games from 2004 onwards, for strong personal reasons. As a result of a stroke, a 'brain attack', and a loss of much of my eyesight, I had missed seeing many top-level encounters. It was time to rectify this gap, and to try to study the game properly.</p>
<p>How could I decide which games to use in this book? There soon turned out to be an obvious and natural answer. Cany Kasparov retired at the beginning of 2005. My aim was to select a game from Linares 2005, and then to give a win by
<!--p>9</p--><!--p>Modern Chess: Move by Move</p-->
any players who were over 2700 at any stage since the beginning of that Linares. What I had not appreciated at the time was that this involved 33 players. This involved roughly twice as many players to study, and twice as many games, than I had originally anticipated.</p>

<h3>A Summary of the Outcome of the Game</h3>
<p>In each of these 33 games, one of the players wins, and consequently the opposing player must have made a mistake. It is quite possible that both players may have made a mistake. If neither player makes a mistake, the game necessarily ends up as a draw.</p>
<p>In only one game, the Jakovenko one, have I deliberately chosen in advance a game in which the winner made a serious mistake, but then recovered. In many other games, when I made my selection, I felt that in many lines the win seems so paradoxical that this must immediately be chosen as of great interest. Sometimes such a game will, under closer examination, prove to be a flawless brilliancy. More often alas, it will prove to be interesting but almost certainly unsound.</p>
<p>It is hoped that none of the chosen games is boring, too one-sided, or contains too many amateur mistakes.</p>
<p>After having attempted to analyse in detail over thirty games, it is of some interest to give an assessment of how many of these wins prove to be flawless, or perhaps only with minor flaws (for example, a slight hesitancy on move 39), and how many of these wins prove, on closer examination, to contain mistakes made on both sides. It often is the case that the ultimate winner tried too hard to win early on, and overpressed, but that the opponent felt under pressure, and also made mistakes.</p>
<p>We can jot up the preliminary results.</p>

<h4>1) Clean wins</h4>

<p>Thus two-thirds of the games may be regarded as clean games, which does not necessarily imply that the winner played a 'textbook' win, clearly refuting the opponent's play in classic style, although some such games are included. This seems an impressively high proportion. In my previous book, Great Attackers, based on games by the young Kasparov, Tal and Stein, there is a far fewer proportion of clean wins, certainly so if one excludes textbook games when the loser makes an unnecessary mistake early on, and the winner makes an attractive exhibition. Play seems to have tightened up since a generation ago. One obvious tendency is that with the help of the computer, strong players have been able to analyse much
<!--p>10</p--><!--p>Introduction</p-->
deeper, and cut out so many plausible slips. In many of the most complicated lines in this book, both players will have been able to examine the position at home, and will have avoided mistakes in the first twenty moves, even in the most complicated lines. Yet wins still happen!</p>

<h4>2) Not so clean wins</h4>
<p>Kasparov*, <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/01-kasimdzhanov-kasparov.htm' %}">Game 1</a>; Topalov*, <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/04-topalov-anand.htm' %}">Game 4</a>; Akopian, <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/11-karpov-akopian.htm' %}">Game 11</a>; Polgar, <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/15-sokolov-polgar.htm' %}">Game 15</a>; Shirov, <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/17-shirov-illescas_cordoba.htm' %}">Game 17</a>; Jakovenko, <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/20-ni_hua-jakovenko.htm' %}">Game 20</a>; Alekseev, <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/21-alekseev-tkachiev.htm' %}">Game 21</a>; Kamsky*, <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/24-kamsky-carlsen.htm' %}">Game 24</a>; Morozevich, <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/25-morozevich-sakaev.htm' %}">Game 25</a>; Cheparinov, <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/27-cheparinov-nepomniachtchi.htm' %}">Game 27</a>*; and Ni Hua, <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/32-inarkiev-ni_hua.htm' %}">Game 32</a>.</p>
<p>An asterisk indicates that the doubt is according to whether the opening is completely accurate, and that the rest of the game seems clean. In most of the other games, the problem is one of over-exuberance.</p>
<p>A simple list of statistics is useful, but also only the start of our analysis. We need to move further.</p>
<p>Many of the doubly-flawed games given above are of such extreme complexity that even the strongest of strongest grandmasters, such as Topalov, Anand and Shirov will make serious mistakes, but usually through excessive imagination, rather than lack of understanding.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting encounters is <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/17-shirov-illescas_cordoba.htm' %}">Game 17, Shirov-Illescas</a>. This illustrates the great dilemma in attacking chess. On the one hand, the choice is to go for the imaginative and dangerous attack, with the full knowledge that he will be unable to calculate everything through to the end, and that he could easily miss a vital resource. On the other hand, he could play solidly. Illescas's resource would have been extremely difficult to find over the board, and indeed he later missed it, and lost. Shirov could have played objectively quieter, still with good results. But what a game!</p>
<p>An even more extravagant encounter is <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/04-topalov-anand.htm' %}">Game 4, Topalov-Anand</a>, where Topalov sacrificed a knight in the opening, almost out of thin air. Anand's king was slightly exposed, but could it really work? It turned out that Black's light-squared weaknesses were just about serious enough to give White interesting attacking chances, so long as White did not mind sacrificing the exchange as well. This was amazing play, but Anand had a couple of good opportunities to improve his play, and rather less complicated than Illescas's slip. Topalov too made a slip later.</p>
<p>A third flawed win is <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/20-ni_hua-jakovenko.htm' %}">Game 20, Ni Hua-Jakovenko</a>. Here Jakovenko was caught by his opponent's opening preparation, and was soon in deep trouble with his king, fastened down by his opponent's queen and bishop. It was startling for the author to find that he was able to win. There was indeed a win, but Ni Hua missed a tactic. Under the microscope, there were other slips by either side beforehand, so it was not quite the perfect defence after a serious mistake.</p>
<p>The wins by Polgar, Alekseev and Morozevich all demonstrated considerable enterprise, but perhaps excessively so. In <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/21-alekseev-tkachiev.htm' %}">Game 21, Alekseev-Tkachiev</a>, White's idea, of <b>Bc1-g5-c1</b>, just to provoke an <b>...f6</b> pawn push, is wonderfully original; a new idea in a recently explored opening, but sadly one cannot fully believe it.</p>
<!--p>11</p--><!--p>Modern Chess: Move by Move</p-->
<p>As so often in battles between attack and defence, <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/15-sokolov-polgar.htm' %}">Game 15, Sokolov-Polgar</a>, saw the eventual winner play more consistently aggressive chess than her opponent, and won, but objectively the win seems to be not quite convincing. In the end, Polgar reached victory with a string of sacrifices in front of the opposing king.</p>
<p>This previous game was relatively finely balanced. Morozevich's win. <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/25-morozevich-sakaev.htm' %}">Game 25</a>. was, it has to be admitted, much more of a sophisticated hack, but with an excellent tactical finish. See the comments on the discussion on symmetrical openings.</p>
<p><a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/27-cheparinov-nepomniachtchi.htm' %}">Game 27, Cheparinov-Nepomniachtchi</a> led to an extremely sharp sacrificial gambit from the opening. Many of the other games in this collection are just as sharp, but in the end seem to be sound. In the Cheparinov game, momentarily Black had the chance of a serious edge, but Nepomniachtchi recaptured a pawn at the wrong time. It was to Nepomniachtchi's credit that he found probably the best line in the opening battle, when many players would have folded much earlier. Sometimes, when tactical play dominates, there is only a small gap between safety and a quick loss.</p>
<p><a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/32-inarkiev-ni_hua.htm' %}">Game 32, Inarkiev-Ni Hua</a>, was another gambit line, this time, one suspects, the product of improvisation rather than close analysis. Black had positional pressure, and there were plenty of tactical opportunities throughout, making it difficult for the defender. Ni Hua won, but the gambit was unnecessary, as he could easily have gained equality without risk.</p>

<h3>Attack on the King</h3>
<p>We have noted the slightly suspect attacking wins, and we have already suggested that there is often a strong degree of risk when playing for an attack. It is more remarkable, perhaps, quite how many of these attacks prove to be sound, in often incredibly sharp games. The ultimate winner not only senses that the apparently risky attack proves to be sound, but also avoids making any serious mistakes in the subsequent play. This is quite an achievement.</p>
<p>If neither attacker nor defender avoids mistakes, the end result should be a draw, however wild the position is. An extremely sharp sacrifice could end up as a draw by perpetual check. This is not accidental, but absolutely central to the theory of positional chess. The attacker cannot force checkmate, as he has not got enough pieces. The defender's king cannot reach complete safety, however, and he cannot take full advantage with the extra material. Play through many of the sidelines in these games, and you will find many examples of perpetual checks.</p>
<p>The impression still remains, though, that in practical terms it is more likely for the attacker to win than the defender in a tense position.</p>

<h3>Winning Opening Innovations</h3>
<p>A new idea in the opening can often be just as devastating in the era of the computer, as under the chess of old. Consider <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/31-mamedyarov-nepomniachtchi.htm' %}">Game 31, Mamedyarov-Nepomniachtchi</a>. Quite clearly, Mamedyarov has thought long and hard about the Semi-Slav, and has found something sharp and original, even from an early stage. This is quite an
<!--p>12</p--><!--p>Introduction</p-->
achievement. Nepomniachtchi found himself off-balance, and had to improvise. He found a plausible way of counter-attacking by threatening a knight with a check, but Mamedyarov simply carried on his pawn storm, with the help of tactics based on discovered checks.</p>
<p>This game was played in April 2008. As a matter of policy, I have made a cut-off point of analysis in all games in this book, not considering any games played after then. There are probably some extremely relevant games in the year beyond. I do not as yet know. All I have is my own thoughts, which might be good or not so good. Others will no doubt take the chance of analysing these new ideas.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the other great quick theoretical win, <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/06-karjakin-anand.htm' %}">Game 6, Karjakin-Anand</a> is now very much a side-line, not so much because the line of the loser was abandoned, but rather because the line of the winner was abandoned. What happened is that both players were studying a newly fashionable position, and both players were considering a particular position, which at first sight looked good for White, and Karjakin played it, having analysed it. Anand anticipated this, playing effectively a second-string option in order allow his opponent to fall for a brilliant double-piece attack.</p>
<p>In contrast, in <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/28-eljanov-ponomariov.htm' %}">Game 28, Eljanov-Ponomariov</a>, Eljanov decided to try some offbeat theory, and quickly lost. The idea was far from senseless, and indeed there may well have been an improvement for White, with chances of a slight edge. Eljanov developed his pieces actively, but his king was slightly exposed, if somehow Ponomariov could get at the king. A well-reasoned pawn sacrifice, to open up lines against the king, cut back Eljanov's attempts, and he soon made a tactical oversight, losing quickly.</p>

<h3>More Attacking Games...</h3>
<p>Not all attacking games are won so quickly, of course.</p>
<p>Sometimes games may become remarkably intense, bolstered by the possibility that both White and Black have studied the opening in great detail, perhaps twenty moves or so deep. There will still be unexplored complications over the next twenty moves, and quite often some extremely complicated lines may arise. <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/19-van_wely-radjabov.htm' %}">Game 19, Van Wely-Radjabov</a>, was a sequel to a long theoretical battle between the two participants. Not even such players of the positional resourcefulness as Radjabov and Van Wely could have played such intensive and accurate chess without the help of home analysis. This must surely be regarded as a great tactical game, with both players having to find great ingenuity. Even the apparent slight slips around move 27, by both players, while writing up their games for publication, will have their reason. Sometimes if you have to play the same opening again, it is best not to give away all one's secrets.</p>
<p>For this writer, the ideal game of chess would involve sharp theoretical thinking, good and accurate play by both sides, outstandingly wild tactics, plenty of paradox on both sides, and if at all possible, interesting endgame play. In the Van Wely-Radjabov game, we did not have the endgame battle, but with <b>27.Bb3!?</b> that
<!--p>13</p--><!--p>Modern Chess: Move by Move</p-->
would have followed. White's queen and two bishops would have been strangely ineffective in an endgame against queen, knight and pawn.</p>
<p>Advocates of the King's Indian will often argue that this opening is the most interesting of all openings. We have just discussed a win by Black, but White too may come on top. Our next example, <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/29-bu_xiangzhi-zvjaginsev.htm' %}">Game 29, Bu Xiangzhi-Zvjaginsev</a>, is a complete all-out attack in a Samisch, White rushing through the g- and h-pawns, and being prepared to abandon a few pawns, and giving up pieces as well. All depends on forcing the black king into the open, by chopping off a few black pawns, and eliminating the dark-squared bishop in front of Black's king. My initial assumption was that White's attack was probably unsound. I am pleased to say that Bu Xiangzhi's play seems to holds water. If so, this is an excellent result for the attack.</p>
<p>In a different opening, the Ruy Lopez, <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/14-navara-socko.htm' %}">Game 14, Navara-Socko</a>, caused considerable theoretical interest. Navara sacrificed a knight on g5 for two pawns, to pin Black's knight against the queen. The main motif in the game was the struggle against the knight. Nevertheless, the slightest lapse by Black on the kingside would soon lead to a mating attack.</p>
<p><a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/02-dreev-dominguez.htm' %}">Game 2, Dreev-Dominguez</a>, was an entertaining attacking game, with sacrifices in front of the black king. White had previously given up both f- and g-pawns to open up lines for the rook, and Black's knight was stuck on the edge on h3, unable to return to help defend. Dreev's initial pawn sacrifice seemed sound, but there is the possibility that he overpressed later on. Dominguez, however, did not find the best move, and lost.</p>

<h3>Winning the Endgame</h3>
<p>So ends the theme of tactics against the king. This is an important part of chess, but by no means the whole of chess. If Black defends fully accurately. White cannot force a win by a direct mating attack.</p>
<p>One might argue that any other type of win could be regarded as a 'positional', unless there is a gross attack by the loser. Sometimes the last part of a win is through tactics, although throughout the preliminaries the battle has been mainly positional. Jumping ahead, <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/30-gelfand-alekseev.htm' %}">Game 30</a>, Gelfand's win in this book is very much of this kind.</p>
<p>Before this, we consider endgame wins.</p>

<h4>Pure Endgame Strategy</h4>
<p>It is a remarkable achievement in chess to create a pure endgame win, where the player keeps a microscopic edge, and holds it, keeping a slight advantage through to the endgame without any distraction of tactical complications. Then at the end of the game, one wonders how on earth the loser made a mistake, all his moves ending up so natural, and yet leading to a zero.</p>
<p>There are also games in which it is clearly level at the start of the endgame, and yet one of the players makes a microscopic slip, and his position deteriorates, and continues to deteriorate. Endgames win games.</p>
<!--p>14</p--><!--p>Introduction</p-->
<p>Kramnik is perhaps the greatest exponent of the microscopic edge in current chess. Our next example, <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/13-kramnik-leko.htm' %}">Game 13, Kramnik-Leko</a>, is already a modern classic. There is a flurry of tactics in the opening, but this is a very well-known line, where the queens soon get exchanged, and many games at high level soon end up as quick draws. Kramnik wonders, though, whether he can still play for a win, with the comfortable option of taking the draw at any time. It works. The pawn structure is almost symmetrical, but Kramnik has slightly the better bishop in an opposite-coloured bishop ending, and his knight is more forceful than Black's. Kramnik scored the full point.</p>
<p>Then there is another bishop and opposite-coloured endgame, this time with a couple of extra rooks on either side. <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/23-carlsen-tiviakov.htm' %}">Game 23, Carlsen-Tiviakov</a>, looked as though it had been heading for a draw for a long time, but Carlsen fixed on a slight opportunity for his bishops, with his own bishop on d4 being protected by a pawn on e3, while Black's bishop had no coverage to protect the pawn on d5. Before too long, Tiviakov was close to zugzwang.</p>
<p>In <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/22-stellwagen-eljanov.htm' %}">Game 22, Stellwagen-Eljanov</a>, Black puts in a lot of hard work in a Berlin Variation, Ruy Lopez, but it is difficult to try for an edge, his c-pawns being doubled, and White having an extra kingside pawn. Eljanov sets up a thematic pawn sacrifice to double his opponent's pawns, but even here this does not seem to force a win. Stellwagen blunders, presumably short of time, exchanging his bishop for knight, with a losing pawn endgame. Remarkably, it would seem that the knight could have been left on the board, allowing the loss of a couple of pawns, but with a likely draw.</p>

<h3>Clear-cut Positional Chess</h3>
<p>There are many more examples on the endgame to be considered, but these tend to lead to complicated mixtures of middlegame and endgame themes. We will consider these later. For the time being, we concentrate on clear-cut positional chess in the middlegame. The attack on the king in such games is only a subsidiary feature. If, furthermore, the player with an edge cannot force an extra pawn, or another material edge, then what happens next? The answer is to try to take control of weak squares. There is no point in playing for a quick attack, but maybe twenty moves later, the player on top starts to think about playing for checkmate.</p>
<p>Perhaps my favourite example is <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/03-adams-yusupov.htm' %}">Game 3, Adams-Yusupov</a>. It is pure positional chess, and Adams plays the middlegame very accurately. He also plays it highly imaginatively. The <b>Qh1</b> idea, hiding behind the king and pawns, does not actually get played, but as so often the most interesting moves are found in the analysis, rather than in the game. Yusupov accepts an isolated d-pawn, quite a common strategy in the French and various other openings. The pawn is slightly weak, and there is a slight weakness in front of the pawn, but this will hardly be enough to win the game. Adams needs to find some extra little weakness, and his queen rushes around with great agility, trying to attack several of the opponent's pieces, prodding the occasional pawn to advance, and then buzzing away, maybe to attack
<!--p>15</p--><!--p>Modern Chess: Move by Move</p-->
something else. The queen is the star piece here, both in the early stages, and in mopping up later.</p>
<p>Black also suffers a slight weakness on the d-file in the Pelikan/Sveshnikov Variation. Black's pawn on d6 is backward, and there is a hole on d5. The games of Sveshnikov and others suggest that while the pawn structure looks ugly, Black also has serious compensation on the other files. Leko has been a strong advocate of Black in this opening, but on the other side of the board in <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/09-leko-radjabov.htm' %}">Game 9, Leko-Radjabov</a>, he shows great understanding of the problems he can set up as White. The star idea in this game is <b>19.Ne3-f5! g6 20.Ne3</b>, giving away a couple of tempo to provoke Black into advancing a pawn. This pawn advance later led to serious weaknesses.</p>
<p>In this context, there is also the extraordinarily extravagant line White chose in <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/21-alekseev-tkachiev.htm' %}">Game 21, Alekseev-Tkachiev</a>. Alekseev has already gambited a pawn in a recently fashionable line, and then he 'gambits' a couple of tempi with <b>10.Bc1-g5 h6 11.Bc1</b>. All he has is that Black's pawn structure is slightly weakened, and during the rest of the game he prods the kingside pawns just a little further, and in the end breaks through against the king. It would have been the positional game of the century if it not only worked, but was fully sound. Sadly Tkachiev had several possible improvements, which he avoided, and so the game is merely interesting.</p>

<h4>Symmetrical Pawn Structures</h4>
<p>We have already noted the outstanding win by Kramnik against Leko. <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/33-karjakin-inarkiev.htm' %}">Game 33, Karjakin-Inarkiev</a>, leads to a broadly similar pawn structure, but with queens remaining on the board, rather than Kramnik's earlier queen exchange. Karjakin knew exactly what he was doing, and set up the better bishop-pair in the symmetrical pawn structure. A good positional win.</p>
<p><a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/24-kamsky-carlsen.htm' %}">Game 24, Kamsky-Carlsen</a> leads to another symmetrical pawn structure, with the player with the more active pieces improving his position, and later winning. Kamsky was able to force his opponent on to the defensive when he was starting to press for a weak pawn. In the earlier part of the game, however, Kamsky's play was inaccurate, and Carlsen could have taken his chances.</p>
<p>There was an attempt for White to blast through with a kingside attack in a symmetrical opening, in <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/25-morozevich-sakaev.htm' %}">Game 25, Morozevich-Sakaev</a>. He succeeded, but it should not really have worked. Sakaev himself overpressed, when the position started to favour him, and Morozevich in reply set up some sacrificial pawn breaks. The tactics were memorable, but the positional play was not at its highest level.</p>

<h4>More Space in the Centre</h4>
<p>Strong players will take care with the centre, and will not give way there unnecessarily. There are relatively few examples in this collection of players playing much too quietly, and just waiting for the opponent to take a big advantage. Books of this type a few decades ago might well have given illustrative games, analysed in depth, of masters beating amateurs, but such games are now relatively rare in top
<!--p>16</p--><!--p>Introduction</p-->
grandmaster encounters. There might occasionally be games in which a player is slow on the uptake in a sharp tactical opening, the Mamedyarov win (<a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/31-mamedyarov-nepomniachtchi.htm' %}">Game 31</a>) being an obvious example, but usually the top grandmasters will not play passively and make unnecessary moves.</p>
<p>The only real example, perhaps, is <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/08-sargissian-nisipeanu.htm' %}">Game 8, Sargissian-Nisipeanu</a>, after an early <b>...b5</b> thrust in the Benoni, here a Blumenfeld Counter-Gambit rather than a Benko or one of the lines of the King's Indian. Black's <b>...b5</b> worked, and he was able to break open his opponent's queenside pawns, and create a central piece advantage for himself. These days, players need to be aware of these <b>...b5</b> thrusts.</p>
<p>Black was able to keep an advantage in the centre in <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/11-karpov-akopian.htm' %}">Game 11, Karpov-Akopian</a>, but this was against the run of earlier play. Karpov developed well, and kept a slight edge, but somehow he found himself tied up with an unnecessary and wasteful knight manoeuvre. Then Akopian started to take over the initiative.</p>
<p>Not really covering the basic theme, but still well worth noting is <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/05-bacrot-rublevsky.htm' %}">Game 5, Bacrot-Rublevsky</a>, where White kept slightly the better pawn structure. The unusual feature was that as White, Bacrot was able to stick his bishop on h6, preventing Black from castling kingside, and keeping a slight edge through to the endgame.</p>
<p>Pressure in the centre often coincides with countervailing pressure on other parts of the board. <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/30-gelfand-alekseev.htm' %}">Game 30, Gelfand-Alekseev</a>, allowed White pawn control in the centre, with pawns on d4 and e4, while Black kept an extra pawn battalion on the queenside. Black castled queenside, and his pawns looked sturdy. Gradually, however, Gelfand was able to exchange a couple of queenside pawns, and then a central break allowed him to set up an attack against the king.</p>

<h3>Unusual Piece and Pawn Battles</h3>
<p>Finally we have a few unusual battles with an imbalance of pieces and pawns. My instincts would not regard these games as gambit lines. In none of the games is the player speculating any material in return for the possibility of a strong attack against the king. Rather, both players are trying to calculate what degree of compensation there is, in positional terms, for any slight degree of material imbalance.</p>
<p>There are two outstanding games of this type, both ending up in an endgame, so neither winner was aiming for mate. By coincidence both games end up as a rook sacrifice in the endgame.</p>
<p><a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/16-shirov-aronian.htm' %}">Game 16, Shirov-Aronian</a>, is classified as the Marshall Gambit, and hence a gambit. It is now almost a century since Frank Marshall introduced his big idea, and the line has now been highly analysed, and the immediate shock effect has gone. There are lines where White can go wrong quickly, falling for a mating attack, but by now the Marshall Gambit is a highly respectable 'positional gambit', or perhaps, if one prefers, a positional sacrifice. In fact, it is Shirov as White who gives up rook for bishop, to neutralize Black's kingside pressure. Shirov also keeps a couple of extra pawns, so material is arithmetically level (3+1+1=5). Both players will need to consider what impact an extra rook would have for Black, and what
<!--p>17</p--><!--p>Modern Chess: Move by Move</p-->
impact each of the bishop and two pawns would have for White, In addition, there are clear weak squares on either side, but what impact would each of these pawns give to the game? We are dealing with immense positional complexity, and it is far from surprising that both players make slight slips at some stages. Shirov finds himself close to zugzwang before the time control, but he counterattacks with sudden tactics. The finish is memorable.</p>
<p><a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/07-svidler-topalov.htm' %}">Game 7, Svidler-Topalov</a>, is another titanic struggle, the more so in that Topalov, like Shirov in the game before, was keeping an eye of the possibility of aiming for a win. In a queenless middlegame, Svidler bravely gave away a central pawn, and indeed gave away a central square in order to press forward with a pawn on the king-side. He was not aiming for checkmate, nor even to create a passed pawn, but rather to make it difficult for Black to coordinate his pieces. Svidler was taking note that Black's extra pawn on the queenside was doubled, and so Topalov could not take any real active advantage of the extra pawn. White had the better kingside pressure with his pawns, but with no extra pawn on that side. It was a long, hard struggle, and eventually Svidler, like Aronian, found a spectacular endgame finish.</p>
<p><a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/10-ivanchuk-aronian.htm' %}">Game 10, Ivanchuk-Aronian</a>, is one of the most interesting material imbalances of all, with Ivanchuk accepting three minor pieces in return for a queen. Games with rook, minor piece and pawn against queen are relatively common, with perhaps a piece dropping along the way. Three pieces against the queen is unlikely to happen unless there has already been a sharp sacrificial attack against the king, and the exposure of the king is likely to dominate the questions of strategy. In the Ivanchuk-Aronian game, both kings are relatively secure, with an unusual struggle. The usual rule of thumb in lines with queen versus assorted material is that if the various lesser pieces are secure, without serious pawn weaknesses, the player with the lesser pieces will tend to dominate. The queen cannot make much impact against the opponent, if the opponent's pieces are firmly defending all attacks. In Ivanchuk's game, it looks at first as though his position is insecure, but with original and accurate play, he gradually takes control.</p>
<p>Another much more common imbalance is the exchange sacrifice. In <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/01-kasimdzhanov-kasparov.htm' %}">Game 1, Kasimdzhanov-Kasparov</a>, Black's exchange sacrifice is delicately balanced, and the suspicion is that at one stage after the exchange sacrifice, Kasparov may have been slightly worse. This though would need practical testing. Kasimdzhanov would undoubtedly have been under considerable psychological pressure, and was unable to find the best lines. Kasparov, throughout his very early days, and up to his final top grandmaster tournament, excelled in taking his play very close to the edge, giving the opponent the chance to play for an edge if he were to play with 100% accuracy, but giving himself the opportunity of playing for a win after the slightest inaccuracy by his opponent.</p>
<p><a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/26-wang_yue-movsesian.htm' %}">Game 26, Wang Yue-Movsesian</a>, is another exchange sacrifice from the opening, based on an idea by Topalov. In Kasparov's win, he obtains more active pieces and pawns for himself, without directly attacking anything. Here, Wang Yue is aiming to keep his opponent's pieces behind in development for as long as
<!--p>18</p--><!--p>Introduction</p-->
possible. The position remained unbalanced, until Movsesian made a strange and unexplained piece sacrifice leading to a clear loss.</p>
<p>Now for some battles of the minor pieces. There are plenty of examples of the 'minor exchange sacrifice', accepting bishop and knight or, less commonly, the two knights, against the bishop-pair. There are several examples of this theme, which is highly relevant to the Berlin Variation of the Ruy Lopez, the Nimzo-Indian, and various other openings. For another example, in the Scotch, consider <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/18-rublevsky-grischuk.htm' %}">Game 18, Rublevsky-Grischuk</a>. White finds no advantage with the bishop-pair, and Black has the more active bishop, and as time goes on, his knight becomes even more dominating. We have not catalogued all the bishop and knight struggles in this book, but the reader is recommended to pay considerable attention to this strategic battle.</p>
<p>The bishop-pair takes its revenge though in <a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/12-bareev-efimenko.htm' %}">Game 12, Bareev-Efimenko</a>, a Nimzo-Indian. Bareev has carefully worked out that while Black's queen and bishop on the long diagonal look threatening. White can cover the attack against his king, and his bishop-pair work better than the bishop and knight. The main basic difference between this game and the Grischuk win for the bishop and knight is that in Bareev's game his pawn structure is far more fluid, with the bishops being able to attack, and the opposing knight is unable to be firmly established.</p>

<h3>The Best of the Best</h3>
<p>This last classification gives us a useful opportunity to give a few suggestions of the best of the great games in the early post-Kasparov years. It needs to be emphasized that this selection of 33 games was a personal selection, and that I had not analysed in depth in advance any of the other candidate games. I have given, for example, only one win by Topalov, but there are genuine doubts as to whether his win was sound. It would seem more than likely that there are several Topalov startling wins which are totally sound and brilliant, and may well be very high up in a top five list.</p>
<p>Of the imperfect sieving from the best games since Kasparov's retirement in early 2005 to April 2008, we have several excellent and outstanding games to consider. Which is the best of the best? Everyone would have different points of view. My short-list would perhaps be the wins by Svidler, Aronian, Adams, and Radjabov among the longer games, and among the opening shock wins, Mamedyarov, Anand and Bu Xiangzhi. These all come quickly to my mind, but there are many other possibilities.</p>
<p>Out of this suggested short-list, I leave it to the reader to decide which he or she thinks of as best. Quite possibly players of different strengths would give different values over the idea of which game is best, and everyone will have different opinions.</p>

<h3>Other Players in the Hall of Fame</h3>
<p>We have given wins by all those players who passed 2700 level between the time of Kasparov's retirement, and April 2008. Quite a few players have since reached
<!--p>19</p--><!--p>Modern Chess: Move by Move</p-->
2700. Quite a few other players have passed 2700, and then dropped down again. Also, there was no international Elo rating system before the 1970s. Retrospective calculations have suggested that many World Champions will have reached something between 2670 and 2690, with Fischer going beyond 2700. There has been, as noted earlier, a degree of inflation since these calculations have been made, and it is reasonable enough to suggest that all modern World Champions can be regarded as 2700 level. This would include Lasker, a superb exponent of the middle-game. Had he somehow been transported into 21st Century play, he would undoubtedly have been able to catch up with opening ideas, and would have done well. With Steinitz, the assessment is not so clear. He was a great thinker of his time, but to modern players, there are many obvious weaknesses in his play. We include in the Hall of Fame:</p>
<p>1) World Champions from Lasker to just before Kasparov's reign</p>
<p>Emanuel Lasker, Jose Capablanca, Alexander Alekhine, Max Euwe, Mikhail Botvinnik, Vassily Smyslov, Mikhail Tal, Tigran Petrosian, Boris Spassky, Bobby Fischer, and Anatoly Karpov. Also David Bronstein, and Viktor Korchnoi.</p>
<p>2) Players who have passed 2700, but have since dropped down again</p>
<p>Valery Salov, Alexander Beliavsky, Loek Van Wely, Rustam Kasimdzhanov, Alexander Khalifman, Zurab Azmaiparashvili, Nigel Short (he has very recently passed 2700 again), Michal Krasenkow, Ivan Sokolov, and Ilia Smirin.</p>
<p>3) The 33 current players given in this book</p>
<p>There has been a minor technicality in this book, in that players of exactly 2700 are not included, and that only players of 2701 or more are included. There is a practical reason. Three players in the period covered in this book have reached exactly 2700, but not gone beyond. This would make the book several pages longer. We add these three players to the Hall of Honour, though: Viktor Bologan, Krishnan Sasikiran, and Sergei Tiviakov. Also Vladimir Malakhov, who reached 2700 at the start of 2004, but a few months later dropped back.</p>
<p>4) The players who have passed 2700 since April 2008.</p>
<p>Vadim Milov, Lenier Dominguez Perez, Vugar Gashimov, Hikaru Nakamura, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Francisco Vallejo Pons, Sergei Rublevsky, Sergei Movsesian, and Alexander Motylev.</p>
<p>We may feel reasonably confident of assessing the players up to the 1960s. During the Fischer era, it was clear that so many strong grandmasters were so far behind Fischer that they could not be regarded as 2700+ players. There were too many 6-0 results during this era.</p>
<p>There are many statistical problems to encounter between the ratings of the 1970s and 1980s, and the current rating performances. We may feel reasonably confident that in their best years, Jan Timman and Leonid Stein would have
<!--p>20</p--><!--p>Introduction</p-->
reached 'hall of fame' level. Are we to say definitely that Timman is a lesser player than both Euwe and Van Wely? Presumably not. Stein's record, with three USSR Championship wins, and his consistent plus score results against world champions, must surely be regarded on the highest level.</p>
<p>Such highly conscientious analysts as Lev Polugaevsky and Lajos Portisch achieved ratings well over 2600 in the 1970s, before the most recent slight inflation. It is possible to argue that they could be regarded as scoring very slightly less than the 2700 level much of the time, but that had they had the access of computer technology, they would have passed the current 2700 level.</p>
<p>But before we get too enthralled with the statistics, it is the chess that matters.</p>
