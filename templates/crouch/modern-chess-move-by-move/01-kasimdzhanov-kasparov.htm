<p>Black usually strongpoints the pawn on d5 with this or

is possible. Usually White recaptures the pawn without too much difficulty with <b>e3</b> (or <b>e4</b>) and <b>Bxc4</b>, so it is not really a proper gambit. If, for example,

, and White keeps a pleasant slight advantage. One of the points of the Slav Defence with
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3", this, "c7c6"); ' class="line1">2...c6</span>

</p>
<p>The one slight practical defect of the Slav Defence for Black, particularly if White is much lower rated (much lower rated that is than the gap between Kasimdzhanov and Kasparov) is that White could simply play for drawish chess with
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3", this, "c4d5"); ' class="line1">3.cxd5</span>

, hoping for a steady equality. Usually this doesn't happen between strong players. It is generally better to play one's normal game as White, hoping for a continued slight advantage and forcing Black to work out how to equalize and hold the position.</p>

</p>
<p>A good and natural move. The classic plan of development in chess is to bring a couple of pawns out into the centre, maybe also the c-pawn, and then bring the knights into play early, moving each knight just once at the beginning. Later, each player decides the best way to bring the bishops into play, and where to castle. The queen and the other rook usually wait until it is clearer where these pieces are best placed. The first thought in opening strategy is to start to bring a few pieces into play, and this includes finding open lines for the bishops. The second consideration is to try to develop flexibly, for attack with White and for defence with Black. It is usually a bad idea to attack in the first half dozen moves. One must develop first.</p>
<p>Opening theory these days can be incredibly deep and complicated; as we shall see Kasparov has prepared an unexpected exchange sacrifice well in advance. Even so, the top players, however deeply they analyse, still concentrate on the basic ideas of opening strategy, and can usually find their way even when they have not previously studied a particular position in advance.</p>
<p>

<p>To the uninitiated, the initial impression would be that Black's pieces seem unnecessarily cramped, his light-squared bishop in particular being stuck behind a closed fortress of pawns, and the knight on a passive square adding to further cramping. This would be deceptive. Black has a plan of attack, with the idea of <b>...dxc4</b>; <b>Bxc4 b5</b> followed by <b>...Bb7</b>, and then it is only a matter of time before a pawn break with <b>...c5</b>. Then the smothered bishop escapes on to a good open diagonal. We will see this plan emerging during the next few moves.</p>

</p>
<p>This is the most direct line, but it also gives up a tempo when compared with, say,

gives White an extra pawn. There was a time when occasionally players with Black would deliberately steer through this line, on the basis that bishops of opposite colour should lead to a draw, even a pawn down.

<p>It is this move that makes the line interesting for Black. After <b>...Bb7</b>, the bishop soon becomes a very active piece once Black has made a <b>...c5</b> pawn push.</p>
<p>Black now has active play, but this does not necessarily mean that Black is better or fully equal. If White plays accurately, then he will still be better or equal. Black cannot be better unless White has made a mistake. If though Black plays actively and aggressively, he is making every chance of inducing his opponent to make an error. Kasparov

<!--p>26</p--><!--p>R.Kasimdzhanov-G.Kasparov, Linares 2005</p-->
<p>We now reach the classic pawn structure of the modern Meran. Black has an excellent queenside pawn majority, well advanced, and he has good diagonals for the bishops and queen. There is no doubt that Black has excellent attacking chances.</p>
<p>White too has his options, otherwise this variation would have become obsolete a long time ago. The main point is that in compensation for Black's pawn advantage on the queenside, White has a good extra pawn on the kingside, with slight damage to Black's kingside pawns. White is not so much trying to create a passed pawn, but rather to put pressure on Black's isolated e-pawn, and thereby on the squares around it.</p>
<p>This is a popular opening for both sides, with the thought that both sides will have to play with great accuracy, and who plays better, wins.</p>

<p>This is not a bad move in itself. It centralizes, puts pressure on Black's e-pawn, and helps open up lines for his kingside. Even so, White's next few moves look far too elaborate, taking three knight moves instead of one in bringing the knight from f3 to g5. White may well be happy in inducing the <b>...e5</b> response, but is it all worth the effort?</p>

<p>Kasparov, like Tal, was always ready to sacrifice, if appropriate, given a reasonable opportunity. Another former World Champion, Tigran V. Petrosian (there is now a strong young namesake, hence the middle initial) was also famed for his positional sacrifices, but with a particular speciality. Petrosian scored many boa-like wins by sacrificing the exchange, giving up a rook for bishop or knight, and showing that in the right type of position he could squeeze all counterplay. Here Kasparov's sacrifice was probably more in the mould of Petrosian, rather than of Tal.</p>
<p>There is also an additional point, which Petrosian would not have had the opportunity to deal with, namely that Kasparov had experience of playing high-level computer opposition. As anyone who has tried using computer help will be aware, computer engines are not necessarily secure of their assessments when sacrifices as concerned. They are far more secure in their evaluation when material is level. In Lutz's commentary for ChessBase, he noted that Kasparov had already considered the diagram position, when preparing for his 2003 match against the computer, Deep Junior. The exchange sacrifice would have been 'psychologically' excellent against computer opposition, but would it necessarily have been so good against human opposition?</p>

<p>This has been criticized by Lutz and others, but it would seem that it is valid. White's mistake comes later.</p>
<p>The intention for White is to simplify by a minor piece exchange, so keeping the rook versus bishop advantage without giving away excessive attacking chances. The exchange on d5 also opens up the b1-h7 diagonal, although this may be obscured by Black's <b>...e4</b> pawn push. Kasimdzhanov's move is not minimal defence, though, as it gives away material.

<p>Kasparov has reasonable compensation for the exchange sacrifice. He has four active pieces, pushing at the king, and a central passed pawn, more effective than White's. What holds for White, or rather what should have held, is that White has good control of the light-coloured squares.</p>

<p>Black's passed pawn is likely to be more troublesome than White's. In attacking terms, it is not quite as effective as it looks, though, since Black is relying heavily on defending with the pawn on the b1-h7 diagonal, and if the pawn moves for an attack, then White may resume play on the light-coloured squares.</p>

<p>This is criticized by Kasparov and by others, but it seems okay. Trying to consolidate on the dark squares usually helps defend on the light squares as well. It is the next move which is questionable.</p>

<p>The position is delicately balanced.</p>
<p>Even the slightest inaccuracy by either side would turn the position to being worse, and any further inaccuracy would slide the position to a clear loss. The author's own assumption in his earlier assessment was that Kasimdzhanov was slightly better at this point, but further consideration suggests that Kasparov's position, as Black, was already slightly better.</p>

<p>White's passed pawn is now securely blockaded, and Black can think about attacking the king. Observe how Black's queen is very difficult to attack, while White will have problems on h2 and g3.</p>
<p>Also, as we shall soon see, there is a knight threat to f4.</p>

<p>Of course, the story is of pawns as well as bishops. Black's passed pawn is much more dangerous than his opponent's, not least because it is much closer to promotion. If White's queen were somehow to abandon the e2-square, Black would quickly play <b>...e2</b>, threatening to take the rook with check, and presumably winning. However if Black's queen were to move away, perhaps with the idea of a quick mating attack. White's d-pawn would require three advances before queening.</p>

<p>Not immediately obvious, but strong. Black covers both the h5- and f5-squares with the pawn, and prevents White's bishop or queen cutting out these squares. The next stage will be <b>...Nh5</b>, and if White does nothing to respond, there will be a threat of <b>...Ng3+</b>; <b>hxg3 Qxg3</b> and a winning <b>...Qh4</b> mate.</p>

<p>Kasparov's tournament chess career is over, as far as we can see, but who is next in line? There is no obvious answer. Some players have reached 2800 occasionally, but only Kasparov has reached that level for any length of time. Kramnik, Anand and Topalov are all great players, but could it be that some of the younger players, such as Karjakin or Carlsen, could reach that level, and maybe go beyond? Or what about various other super-grand-masters?</p>
