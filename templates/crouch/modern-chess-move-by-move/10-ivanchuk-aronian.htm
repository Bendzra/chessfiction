weakness, and White can hit with <b>a4</b>. The Ruy Lopez, the Spanish Game, is much more popular than the Giuoco Piano, the Italian Game, because it has two lines of attack (<b>b5</b> and <b>f7</b>), rather than just a single line of attack, <b>f7</b>.</p>

<p>The pawn structure has now been fixed, and White can feel reasonably happy with the outcome. Black has three slight pawn weaknesses, leaving White something to work with. White's bishop on the a2-g8 diagonal is an irritation, putting pressure on the f7-pawn. As a consequence, it is difficult to provide full protection for the e5-pawn. Black's rook cannot simultaneously provide full cover for both the e-file and the f-file. As a result, he has to make compromises. On the queenside, Black's b-pawn has been encouraged to advance perhaps more quickly than he would have liked, and in consequence, Black's c-file is weakened. White can play, for example, <b>Nd2-c4</b> without much opposition.</p>
<p>Having said that, any advantage for White is still slight, provided Black can play actively. Black was careful earlier to exchange knights, giving up his purely defensive c6-knight in return for taking White's active f3-knight. Simplification usually helps the defender, but it cannot solve every problem.</p>

<p>Ivanchuk takes up the challenge. When writing this book, this was one of the first games to select. It is so rare to be able to find positions with queen versus three minor pieces, much rarer than queen versus rook, minor piece and pawn.</p>
<p>I suspect that in home preparation Aronian would have been happy with this position, seeing White's kingside pawn structure as seriously weakened. However, as play goes on, White's pieces start to work together, and Black's play becomes increasingly difficult. Ivanchuk's play is highly original and insightful.</p>

<p>An unusual material balance. Enjoy it while you can in a game between two top grandmasters.</p>
<!--p>143</p--><!--p>Modern Chess: Move by Move</p-->
<p>The material is in theory about equal (9 = 3+3+3), if we assume that Black's e-pawn will drop. If the e-pawn holds, then maybe Black has a slight edge in terms of material, but of course there are many other issues in the position.</p>
<p>Probably White ought to have the better piece structure, if his minor pieces are well guarded, but his bishop on c1 might well be poorly placed. In terms of pawns, Black's queenside pawns are ineffective, but White has weakened kingside pawns, and his king is isolated.</p>

<p>This is by far the most natural move, with ideas of attacking on h3, and also blocking the bishop on c1.

followed by <b>Kh2</b> and <b>Rg1</b>, and White's pieces are rock solid Black will have to defend weaknesses on the pawn on g7, adding sensitivity to the king, and also along the d-file, and against threats with either bishop or knight from e6. Similarly, if

<p>Pawns may well have been 'the soul of chess', as Philidor may have suggested a quarter of a millennium ago, but the major pieces, the queen and the rooks, are surely the heart of attack.

<p>If White were to find a couple of clear tempi, and bring all his extra pieces into play, then he would be better. Unfortunately, just at the moment his pieces lack coordination, with, for example, his two rooks being immobile (<b>26.Re7?? Rxd3</b>). White has to try something quickly, though, as Black's queen is flexible and mobile, and his pawns can try to open White's kingside with <b>...g5</b> and <b>...g4</b> One senses that there will be tactics:</p>

, and the position has stabilized for both sides.</p>
<p>In Informator, Ivanchuk gives this line as 'unclear' after White's 25th, and before the tactics come up. In terms of practical over-the-board chess, this seems about right. Neither player can show a clear advantage, while in the alternative line the position is also unclear.</p>
<p>Of course, it would have been beyond the event horizon for Aronian to have been able to decide over the board whether

<p>This is an extremely difficult position to interpret, not just in terms of pure chess, but also in terms of chess psychology. Ivanchuk gives this as an exclamation mark, and this is fully understandable in positional terms, developing his queenside pieces, and waiting to see whether the knight should go to d3 or to e4, both good and logical squares, but cannot both be played.</p>

is better, and Ivanchuk gives it, perhaps generously, as 'unclear'. White cannot lose this, in the absence of a serious error, but he has chances of playing for a win. White's rook and knight are both well placed, and he has the advantage of a passed pawn, but how can he make progress with the other pieces, more particularly the two bishops?
