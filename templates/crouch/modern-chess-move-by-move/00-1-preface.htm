<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>This is by far the most ambitious of the various chess books and articles I have written. To have analysed in detail a win by 33 different 2700+ grandmasters against 2600+ strength opposition is a big effort It is fair to say that no writer could even have considered such a task fifteen years ago. One reason is that only Kasparov and Karpov had reached this chess stratospheric level, although a few others were pressing hard. Chess has changed considerably during the age of the computer, and players have had the opportunity of improving their play and understanding considerably.</p>
<p>Without the computer, I myself would only be able to scratch the surface in analysing the games, and would not be able to say with confidence whether such a move is good or a mistake. It is good not to have to guess. Of course, in some positions the play is so complicated, or so subtle, or both, that even the computers and the strongest players would find it beyond themselves to understand everything. Quite often it is a major task of the top players to try to understand what is going on in such difficult lines, on the basis that if the top player has been able to analyse the position in depth at home, and is capable of outplaying the opponent over the board, there is an excellent chance to win. A 2600 grandmaster is still a very strong grandmaster, but a 2700+ grandmaster will take his opponent out of their comfort zone. We must not forget that ultra-sophisticated positional play can also work.</p>
<p>The main dedication I give is to the players who have dedicated themselves to such high levels of chess. Without them, there would have been no book.</p>
<p>The games themselves were at the time completely fresh to me. After a serious brain seizure in 2004, I was fortunate that I was able to play chess, or even see the board. I feel grateful in having the opportunity, with this book, to catch up with so many marvellous games, and even participate in discussing them.</p>
<p>It turned out that it has taken almost a whole year to write up such an effort The world outside has changed considerably in terms of chess, and the world in general. At some stage, I will no doubt want to catch up with the world of chess from Easter 2008 onwards. Outside chess, there has been a year of financial and economic crisis. It seems a long, long time since I wrote a PhD on the economics of recession and unemployment in Britain in the early 1980s, and I would like to think that the argument I made at the time still has merit. The question was always not whether there would be another serious recession, but when. Naturally there has always been the dominant opposite argument, among politicians, economists, journalists and others, that the economy is stable, that there is no such thing as unemployment, that the banks have stabilized growth, and that

politicians have ended the problems of boom and bust. It will be of interest to see how the orthodox thinkers will now empirically justify such a point of view.</p>
