<p>Which move should you adopt? The choice is a matter of taste. Broadly speaking,

tends toward a struggle for positional advantage. Blackburne says. “The first piece of advice I would offer to the young student who wishes to improve his chess is that in the formation of his style he should try to follow his own aptitude and temperament. One player derives pleasure in working a game out accurately like a sum in mathematics; another cares for nothing but ingenious combinations and brilliant attacks. It is by far the best for each to develop his own qualities”</p>

<p>An excellent reply, as it prevents White from continuing with

<p>The text-move is the best way to support the d-pawn after White has attacked it by <b>c4</b>, but White has not yet made this threatening gesture!</p>

<p>This quiet move is the prelude to the Colle Attack, a vicious kingside assault.</p>
<p>The general plan of the Colle is to advance the e-pawn to e4, after suitable preparation. This consists of the following manoeuvres:</p>
<p>1) developing the f1-bishop at d3, to reinforce the pressure on the vital e4-square and to attack Black's h-pawn. a tender point after he castles;</p>
<p>2) posting the queen's knight at d2 (not at c3, as the c-pawn must not be obstructed), to bear down on e4 and lend support to the e-pawn when it reaches that square;</p>
<p>3) castling on the kingside, to mobilize the h1-rook;</p>
<p>4) developing the queen at c2 and/or the rook at c1, to add further weight to the contemplated pawn push:</p>
<p>5) advancing the pawn to c4.</p>
<p>The pawn moves only one square, but it sets all the machinery in motion: the position in the centre will be ripped apart and lines opened for White's attacking forces.</p>

<p>Natural and strong. This is the best possible disposition of the king's knight It is developed toward the centre, so as to lake part in the events there It is in the centre that most of the fighting takes place, and whatever happens there affects the rest of the chessboard. Superiority in the centre is essential for a positional advantage, and control of the centre is indispensable to the successful conduct of a kingside attack.</p>
<p>All development should therefore be conducted with a view to the effect on the centre.</p>
<p>A plausible move, instead of the text, is the advance

to prevent White from placing his bishop at d3. It is the kind of move many players find irresistible, but it must be avoided. It is an error in strategy, as it relaxes the pressure on White's d-pawn and the centre.</p>

<p>Offhand this looks unnatural, as the knight seems awkwardly placed and blocks the path of the c1-bishop. In reality the knight performs its two assigned tasks: it gets into the game,
even if it is only at the modest d2-square, and it also lends support to the coming action at the critical point e4. The c1-bishop is inconvenienced, but only temporarily.</p>

<p>Rooks must seize open files! What if there are none? Then bring your rooks toward the centre! They will then be at the head of files most likely to be opened. That is why the king's rook is usually developed at e8 or d8, while the queen's rook goes to d8 or c8.</p>

White would lose a pawn. The text-move was made with these further considerations in mind:</p>

<p>2) this bishop, needed for the defence of the kingside, will find itself on the wrong side of the board;</p>
<p>3) at e5, the bishop will stand unprotected and subject to a surprise attack;</p>
<p>4) White's knight at d2 will gain a tempo later by moving to b3, where it threatens the exposed bishop while simultaneously clearing a way for his own dark-squared bishop;</p>
