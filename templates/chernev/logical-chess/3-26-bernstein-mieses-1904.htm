<p>This opening, the Sicilian Defence, is currently one of the most popular openings. Black's first move has the defect that only one piece is released, but in one respect it has a similar aim to

: it covers d4 and so makes it more awkward for White to form a 'two-abreast' pawn-centre by playing <b>d4</b>. It White insists on d4, then Black can reply <b>...cxd4</b>, thereby exchanging White's central pawn tor a less central one.</p>
<p>The Sicilian Defence is perfectly sound and leads to a fighting game in which Black has many counterattacking chances, especially against an over-ambitious opponent, too intent on a kingside attack.</p>
<p>Black aims at queenside counterattack, and for this, control of the c-file is essential to offset White's superiority in the centre and on the kingside.</p>

<p>The king is a strong piece and should be used aggressively in the ending. As the number of pieces on the board decreases, so is the danger of the king being exposed to a mating attack reduced, and its own power as a fighting piece magnified. In the ending, the king is unexcelled as a means of causing damage by getting in among the enemy's pawns.</p>

<p>White dominates every important square on the board! The bishop stops the h8-rook from getting to f8, the a6-rook from moving to b6, the king from d6, the d-pawn from advancing and the c-pawn from moving at all! Compare its control of eight squares with that of Black's bishop, whose influence is confined to one square! This difference in their potential accounts in great measure for the extent of White's attacking opportunities, and for the consequent difficulty Black will have in defending. Every gain or control of territory by White will result in more and more cramping of Black's position.</p>
