<p>This move accomplishes a great deal:</p>
<p>• A pawn is fixed in the centre of the board.</p>
<p>• The pawn exerts a grip on d5 and f5, and keeps Black's pieces from settling on those squares.</p>
<p>• White's queen and bishop immediately have breathing space.</p>

White can play the Ruy Lopez, the Giuoco Piano, the Scotch, the Vienna Game or a dan-gerous gambit of some sort</p>
<p>Another is that Black's cramped position may tempt White into a di-sastrous premature attack.</p>

<p>Spielmann, who likes wide-open positions, clears away a couple of pawns to give his pieces more room for their activities.</p>
<p>Which move is better? Which should you play? The answer is: play the move that you like, the one that best suits your style and temperament If you are a careful, cautious player who knows the full value of a pawn - that each one is a potential queen, and that the loss of a pawn may be the loss of the game - stick to

and the openings of positional chess, the Ruy Lopez, the Queen's Pawn openings, the R&#233;ti and the English. On the other hand, if you prefer daring, adventurous chess, and a pawn is simply a barrier to the sweeping onrush of an attack by your pieces, play openings which allow scope for your imagination, the Evans, Danish.

<p>The best openings to play are the ones you are most at home in.</p>

<p>Now we see another reason for developing the knight to c2. White wants to anchor a piece at f5, a dominating position for a knight or a bishop. A piece need do no more than just stand there and look menacing to rattle the opponent.</p>

</p>
<p>...at the cost of a loss of time. Black has made three moves with the knight to exchange it for a bishop that moved only once. More than that, his knight came off the board completely, while the bishop left a piece in its place. The result is that White has four active pieces in play against two of Black's. White is also prepared to castle on cither side and mobilize both rooks quickly. Whatever advantage exists is therefore White's.</p>

<p>This pawn move prevents White from placing his knight at f5, but it creates an organic weakness in Black's position, one that is irremediable. The squares f6 and h6, no longer guarded by the pawn, are weak and remain so permanently.</p>
<p>Notice that the pawn was induced but not forced to move forward. The mere threat of an inroad by the knight was enough to influence Black to make a natural preventive move. It is the sort of move nine out of ten players make automatically in similar situations, which is why it is important to know how to exploit its defects, for no move is weak unless proper advantage is taken of its flaws.</p>

<p>White seizes the only open file (since rooks belong on open files or on files likely to be opened) and pins the bishop.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that a pinned piece not only is unable to move but is also powerless to capture. It does not protect any other pieces, since it is completely paralysed. Hence it follows that not only is the bishop immobilized and in danger of its life (as it may be attacked again and again) but the knight that depends on it for protection is no longer secure. Briefly, Black is now threatened with loss of a piece by

<p>The king lakes refuge in flight, incidentally unpinning the bishop and preserving his knight.</p>
<p>Spielmann's strategy to this point and the decisive combination that follows would have pleased Lasker, who once said. “In the beginning of the game ignore the search for combinations, abstain from violent moves. Aim for small advantages, accumulate them, and only after having attained these ends search for the combination - and then with all the power of will and intellect, because then the combination must ex-ist, however deeply hidden.”</p>

<p>A glance shows that White has achieved the requisite positional superiority. If there is a combination to be evolved, it must be now, before Black has time to reorganize his pieces for defence. Now, while he has five pieces actively in play against two of Black's. Now, while he has an open file - enough! enough! The combination must be there!</p>
<p>Here is White's line of reasoning:</p>
<p>Black's advance of the g-pawn has deprived the knight of stable support. It is still guarded by two pieces, but if the bishop were not there it would be defended only once. In fact, if the bishop were not there, the knight would be pinned and subject to an enduring attack. The bishop appears in both equations. Obviously the bishop is the culprit, and it must be destroyed! And at once, before Black has time for
