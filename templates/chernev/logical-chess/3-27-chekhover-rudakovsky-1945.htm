<p>• The d-pawn is protected and safe from immediate attack.</p>

<p>The characteristic move of the Queen's Gambit. The versatile c-pawn does many things. Three of Three things are concerned with doing away with Black's centre:</p>
<p>• It offers itself in exchange, so that Black may be lured into accepting a side pawn in return for his centre pawn.</p>
<p>• It threatens, when the right moment comes, to destroy Black's centre by capturing the d pawn.</p>
<p>• It exerts constant pressure on the d-pawn, so that Black is kept occupied with its protection.</p>
<p>Besides all this, the move of the c-pawn assures that the c-file is kept free and clear for the convenience of White's major pieces, while a pathway is opened for the queen, leading to the queenside.</p>

<p>This knight must never be developed at c6 before the c-pawn is moved. The pawn must be free, either to advance to c5 and fight for equal rights in the centre or to move one square to c6 where it bolsters Black's own centre. But the pawn must not be obstructed by <b>...Nc6!</b></p>

is that it vacates d1 for the queen's rook, whose presence on the same file as Black's queen will discourage the opponent from making a break in the centre.

<p>Black waited for White to move his f1-bishop before making this capture. Otherwise, the bishop recaptures and develops at the same time. Black's intention, in clearing d5, is to swing his knight over to that square, force some exchanges, and free his cramped position.</p>

<p>The bishop guards both light-squared pawns, but its mobility is almost nil.</p>
<p>The subject of mobility is interesting. While it is not always true that the player whose pieces have more room in which to manoeuvre enjoys an advantage, it applies often enough in practice for us to disregard the exceptional eases. It stands to reason that pieces that are free and untrammelled not only have more striking power in the portion of the board they occupy, but they also control and limit the activities of the enemy. Add to this the ease with which they can reach other parts of the board, and you can see the ad-vantages to be derived from the ability to move freely about.</p>
<p>Let us compare all the moves the pieces on each side can make. We are not evaluating their worth, whether good, bad or indifferent. What we want to see is the range of their action.</p>

. Many a player has had quicker wins or more artistic ones than actually occurred pointed out to him by lesser lights, who revel in the fact that they found something the master overlooked. The reason the master didn't see the shorter line is that he was not looking for it in the first place! The move with which he wins is the one whose effects he foresaw earlier and analysed thoroughly before starting his final combination. Once the series of forcing moves clicks, there is no reason at all for him to waste time finding other moves that might win, it takes time to analyse combinations, and the shorter way, ventured on hurriedly, might turn out to have a hole in it. The moral is: play the move that forces the win in the simplest way and leave the brilliancies to Ale-khine and Keres.</p>
