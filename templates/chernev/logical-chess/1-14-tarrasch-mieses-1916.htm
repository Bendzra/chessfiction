<p>This is an excellent start toward developing the pieces, as lines are immediately opened for the queen and a bishop. The e-pawn itself helps in the battle for the centre by occupying a key square and attacking two others, d5 and f5.</p>

, attacking White's centre. He is then prepared to meet

<p>Naturally! White puts another pawn in the centre, now making e5 and c5 forbidden territory for Black's pieces. Meanwhile, his own queen and dark-squared bishop have more freedom of movement.</p>

</p>
<p>Putting the question to the e-pawn!</p>
<p>White has a choice of various replies:</p>
<p>1)
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3", this, "e4d5"); ' class="line1">3.exd5</span> 
, in order to simplify.</p>
<p>2)

, to cramp Black with the pawn chain.</p>
<p>3)

(also

or, less effectively,
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3", this, "f1d3"); ' class="line1">3.Bd3</span> 
), to protect the pawn and develop a piece at the same time.</p>
<p>The first method was favoured by Morphy, who liked open positions that gave his pieces wide scope for attack. Nowadays it is rarely adopted, as after the exchange of pawns the positions are equal and symmetrical and an attack is difficult to whip up, unless you are a Morphy.</p>
<p>The cramping move
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3", this, "e4e5"); ' class="line1">3.e5</span> 
has a great many advocates, but the argument against this system is that White's pawn chain is rigid and susceptible to undermining tactics. Black initiates a strong counterattack on the base of the pawn-chain by
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6 0 4", this, "c7c5"); ' class="line1">3...c5</span> 
, followed by <b>...Nc6</b> and <b>...Qb6</b>, when White finds himself defending a centre that has lost its flexibility.</p>
<p>There remains the third way, which is simple and consistent with common sense in chess to support the e-pawn and bring a piece out on the scene.</p>
<p class="longNotation">
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3", this, "b1c3"); ' class="line0">3.Nc3</span> 
 <span class="ellipsis0">...</span> 
</p>
<p>Typical Tarrasch: he selects the method which furthers his development and maintains tension in the centre. This move brings a knight out, protects the e-pawn and increases the pressure on d5.</p>

</p>
<p>Tarrasch disapproves of this exchange of pawns, as Black surrenders the centre without obtaining any compensation. If results are a measure of the merit of an opinion, Tarrasch proved his point in this match. Mieses played
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4", this, "d5e4"); ' class="line1">3...dxe4</span>

 <span class="ellipsis0">...</span> 
</p>
<p>Now White has a beautifully centralized knight, pressure on e5 and c5, and a superior pawn position (a pawn at d4 to one at e6) which assures him greater freedom of action.</p>

<p>This is where the king's knight is most useful, so why not place it there at once?</p>
<p>Even the greatest masters do not play startling, bizarre or 'brilliant' moves in the opening in an effort to be different, or to impress others with their ability to find extraordinary moves in commonplace positions. They are content to develop their pieces quickly, placing them on squares where they will operate to greatest effect, and then wait for Nature to lake its course. When the time is ripe for combinative play, the odds are it will turn in favour of the player whose development is superior.</p>

<p>Understandably, Black wants his light-squared bishop on the job and intends developing it at b7. There is danger, though, in attempting this before the king has castled. Not only is there the risk of a check on the a4-c8 diagonal, which might compel the king to move and forfeit his right to castle, but there is also the possibility of White planting a knight on c6, a square weakened by the advance of Black's b-pawn.</p>

<p>Immediately pouncing on the weakened square, with a view to re-moving Black's dark-squared bishop. But why give up the knight, which I said a moment ago was occupying a wonderful outpost, for a bishop that seems to have little potential?</p>
<p>There are at least three good reasons:</p>
<p>• The exchange deprives Black of one of his bishops, and the mere possession of both bishops is a formidable attacking weapon, no matter how placid the position.</p>
<p>• The reduction in material increases the dynamic power of White's pair of bishops, which have more space to work in. The emptier the board, the better they can sweep the area, one operating on light and the other on dark diagonals.</p>
<p>The third reason is rather subtle:</p>
<p>• Black's kingside position is stoutly defended by the knight, and the knight in turn by the bishop and queen In order to get at the knight, which must eventually be destroyed for a kingside attack to succeed. White first removes one of its firm supports, the bishop. The substitution of Black's queen for the bishop will make a pin on the knight a potent one - one which can not easily be shaken off.</p>

<p>White puts paralysing pressure on the knight with this powerful pin.</p>
<p>Before going any further, let's review the bidding:</p>
<p>By doing nothing more remarkable than making simple developing moves. White has an advantage in his pair of bishops, a better all-around position, more pieces in play, and an enduring initiative.</p>
<p>More pieces in play? Yes, his queen and both bishops are actively posted, while Black's knight is unable to move, his queen must hover about the knight (or lose a pawn after <b>Bxf6</b>) and his bishop has little mobility, shut off as it is from the kingside by Black's own c-pawn. The pawn position in the centre also favours White, in that his d-pawn on the fourth rank has more to say about affairs than the enemy pawn at c6.</p>
<p>White now plans to create a breach in the line-up of pawns screening Black's king, by next playing the surprising but logical
