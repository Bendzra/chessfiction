<p>One way of getting a good share of the centre is to take it!</p>
<p>White does so here by planting one of his pawns right in the middle of the board. It occupies d4, one-square, and secures a grip on two others, e5 and c5.</p>

<p>This advance is a valuable freeing move in queen's pawn openings. It attacks the central square d5, makes the c-file a favourable one for the rook (because of the likelihood of the tile being later opened up) and offers the queen access to the queenside.</p>
