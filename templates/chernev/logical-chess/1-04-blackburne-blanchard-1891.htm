<p>Probably the safest way to decline the gambit:</p>
<p>1) The bishop bears down on the centre and controls an excellent diagonal.</p>
<p>2) The bishop supplements the pawn's attack on d4 and prevents White from moving his d-pawn to d4.</p>

<p>This is a poor move on at least four counts:</p>
<p>1) In moving a pawn instead of a piece. Black loses sight of the chief objective in all opening strategy: Move the pieces! Get them off the back rank and on the job!</p>
<p>2) He surrenders his hold on the centre and the privileges it confers.</p>
<p>3) He wastes time capturing a pawn which he cannot retain.</p>
<p>4) He permits White to seize the centre next move, which forces a retreat by his bishop and a consequent loss of time.</p>
<p>Tarrasch considered a move such as the one just made by Black a worse offence than an outright blunder, such as leaving a piece en prise.</p>
<p>Instead of this, Black might better have played

</p>
<p>Of course! No player should take more than half a second to see the power of this pawn push! The pawn seizes control of a good bit of the centre (occupying d4 and attacking two other important squares), dislodges the bishop from its strong position, and uncovers an attack by his own c1-bishop on the f4-pawn.</p>

</p>
<p>All pawn moves have positive and negative aspects. (Tarrasch used to say. “Every pawn move loosens the position.”)</p>
<p>One drawback for White in the advance of his e-pawn is that the occupation of e5 by a pawn deprives his pieces of a useful square. The knight especially operates to great advantage when posted at e5.</p>
<p>In compensation, the pawn exercises a cramping effect on Black's entire position and imposes particular restraint on Black's king's knight, which cannot develop naturally at f6.</p>

</p>
<p>Black is intrigued by the prospect of saddling Blackburne with a doubled pawn, but why capture a piece that is pinned and can do no harm? Why relax the pressure at all?</p>
<p>A more commendable procedure was to bring up the reserves, starting with

 <span class="ellipsis0">...</span> 
</p>
<p>In return for the handicap of the doubled pawns (little enough, since the advance <b>c4</b> forces an exchange and undoubles the pawns) White enjoys advantages in his two bishops and in the open b-file which his rook will put to good use.</p>

<p>A superficial move, as the bishop could develop to greater effect at f5. There it would hinder White from freely posting his bishop at d3, except at the cost of permitting the bishops to be exchanged.</p>
<p>Developing the pieces to squares where they are most effective assures an advantage; preventing the opponent from doing likewise increases it.</p>
<p>It is important to fight for control of the vital squares.</p>

<p>White, who is interested only in completing his development, has not the slightest intention of making either of these moves.</p>
<p>The move <b>...h6</b> by Black (or <b>h3</b> by White) should be played only if the h-pawn is to form a base for an attack by pawns, i.e. if it supports an advance by the g-pawn. Defensively, the move does more harm than good, as it loosens the pawn structure and weakens its resistance to attack. It is especially dangerous if the king has castled on the kingside, as the pawn itself, standing out from the ranks, provides a convenient target. Also (as if the foregoing were not enough) it does nothing to further the cause of development and wastes time which should be devoted to the liberation of pieces which are still shut in.</p>

<p>At one stroke White secures the safety of his king and brings his rook on to an open file. It is true that the file is cluttered up by a knight and bishop, which interfere with the rook's influence, but they are pieces, not pawns, and can move quickly out of the way.</p>

<p>The master makes this move in a flash, while the run-of-the-mill player never even looks at it!</p>
<p>What is the rook's future on this file? It attacks a pawn, but the pawn is easily protected. Why not try for a kingside attack, instead of this futile demonstration?</p>
<p>The answer lies in this; the master's instinct (or perhaps his knowledge or experience) tells him that he must seize any files that are open -control them at once with his rooks or his queen. “Make the moves,” it says, “that conform with the require-ments of the position, and you will be suitably rewarded. Play the moves necessary to establish a superior position! Develop your pieces so that they enjoy maximum mobility, and control most of the territory. Direct your efforts to weakening the enemy position, cramping the movements of his pieces, and reducing the capacity of his resistance before you make the first move of a combination When the time is ripe, the at-tack will play itself The decisive combination will stare you in the face.”</p>

</p>
<p>This too is a move that distinguishes the master from the amateur!</p>
<p>How easy it is to advance the pawn, safeguard it from attack, and let the rook bite on granite! Obvious as this defence is, no top-ranking player would rush to adopt it! He would try to avoid disturbing the pawn formation and consider instead such alternatives as

.</p>
<p>After the actual move, the light squares on Black's queenside have been weakened. More to the point, the advance of the pawn deprives the c6-knight of solid support - a circumstance that White will exploit in his forthcoming attack on the king, away over at the other side of the board.</p>

<p>The queen leaves the first rank to enable the rooks to get in touch with each other. They may wish to increase the pressure on an open file by doubling on it, or otherwise work in concert.</p>

<p>He might then have hit upon

, with the object of swinging the knight to c4. There it blockades the doubled pawn, interferes with the free movement of White's pieces, and in general sticks like a bone in the throat. White could cap-ture the knight, but then he parts with one of his valuable bishops, and as a result of the exchange his pawn position would be inferior to Black's. Finally, Black could then anchor one of his pieces to great effect on d5, a square from which it could never be evicted by pawns.</p>

<p>The danger in playing plausible but perfunctory chess is finely illustrated in this game. Blackburne, who played this and seven other games simultaneously while blindfolded, relied on order and method to achieve victory. It proved easily superior to the move-to-move groping of his sighted opponent.</p>
