<p>In chess, unlike tennis, you cannot win by serving an ace. There is no trick move in the opening that will catch even a fair-to-middling player off-balance.</p>
<p>What you can do is apply order and method in your conduct of this phase, so as to increase your chances of getting a favourable position. All you need do is follow a few simple rules for sound development:</p>
<p>• Begin with
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1", this, "e2e4"); ' class="line1">1.e4</span> 
or
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3 0 1", this, "d2d4"); ' class="line1">1.d4</span> 
, either of which moves releases two pieces.</p>
<p>• Anchor at least one pawn in the centre and give it solid support. Pawns in the centre keep enemy pieces from settling themselves on the best squares.</p>
<p>• Wherever feasible, bring out your knights before the bishops. Broadly speaking, the knights do their best work at f3 and c3 (f6 and c6 when Black), where their power is tremendous for defence as well as offence.</p>
<p>• Of two developing moves, select the more aggressive one. Develop with a threat if you can.</p>
<p>• Move each piece only once in the opening. Place it at once on a square where it has some bearing on the centre and where it has the greatest scope for attack.</p>
<p>• Move at most two pawns in the early stages of the game. Play with the pieces.</p>
<p>• Develop the pieces with a view to controlling the centre, either by occupying it or bearing down on it from a distance, as fianchettoed bishops do.</p>
<p>• Develop the queen, but close to home to avoid her being harassed by pawns and minor pieces.</p>
<p>• Do not chase after pawns at the expense of development.</p>
<p>• Secure the safety of the king by early castling, preferably on the kingside.</p>
<p>Capablanca summed all this up when he said, “The main thing is to develop the pieces quickly: get them into play as fast as you can.”</p>
<p>Now hack to Flohr and Pitschak:</p>
<p>White's first move fixes a pawn in the centre and liberates two pieces.</p>

<p>Black brings his king's knight out to its most favourable post and hin-ders White from continuing with

<p>Napier recalls that in the first of several lessons he took from Stein-itz, the World Champion said, “No doubt you move your knight out on each side before the bishop? And do you know why?” Napier says he was stuck for an intelligent answer. Steinitz went on to explain: “One good reason is that you know where the knight belongs before you know that much of your bishop; certainty is a far better friend than doubt.”</p>

<p>Black strikes a blow at the d-pawn in an attempt to secure control of the centre. This flank thrust is almost compulsory in queen's pawn open-ings because Black must try to disturb White's central formation.</p>

<p>Black too props up his advanced pawn and prepares to fianchetto the c8-bishop.</p>

</p>
<p>Customary practice in this system of attack: the bishop adds his strength to the pressure exerted on c4 in preparation for an advance by the e-pawn, which will open up lines of attack for the pieces in the background. The bishop also aims at Black's h-pawn, a fine target after the enemy king castles on that side.</p>

</p>
<p>This solves one of Black's chief problems in queen's pawn openings an effective disposition of the light-squared bishop. By means of this fianchetto arrangement, the bishop commands the longest diagonal on the board and participates in the fight tor domination of e4, the strategic square in the Colle System</p>

<p>Despite us modest appearance, there is a great deal of latent energy in the placement of this bishop at e7. It is close enough to home to help defend the king, yet easily manoeuvrable to a more aggressive post if occasion requires.</p>

<p>Black seizes the opportunity to dispute possession of the centre. He also puts an end to White's contemplated advance of the e-pawn, as he bears down on the critical e4-square with knight, pawn and bishop, while White has only two pieces trained on it.</p>
