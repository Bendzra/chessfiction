<p>So great an authority as Emanuel Lasker, World Champion for 27 years,

<p>Black follows suit in trumps, developing his king's knight to its most useful square.</p>

<p>Generally, it is dubious strategy to release one bishop while shutting in the other. In this game, White is adopting a system that calls for a storing up of dynamic energy behind the lines, which is released at the right time by an explosion at the key c4-square.</p>
<p>To this end. White develops so that his pieces exert their maximum pressure at e4. His bishop will therefore occupy d3, and his b1-knight will move to d2. It more concentration of force is needed, his queen will supply it by developing at e2, or he may play <b>0-0</b> followed by <b>Re1</b>. Then, with all this potential energy ready to let loose, the e-pawn advances to e4, to rip the position apart and open fire on Black's kingside.</p>
<p>Development in the Colle System is on positional lines, but the objective is a kingside attack!</p>

<p>This is a routine developing move which serves to maintain the symmetry but has the defect of not crossing White's plans. Clearly, it was better strategy either to attack White's pawn-centre by
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq c6 0 4", this, "c7c5"); ' class="line1">3...c5</span> 
or to counter by

. Not only is this latter a simple, sound developing move, but also it prepares to oppose White's bishop, which is headed for d3, with an equal force. The exchange of bishops, which follows sooner or later, will deprive White of a most valuable weapon in kingside attacks.</p>
<p class="longNotation">

 <span class="ellipsis0">...</span>

<p>Notice the difference! White's bishop commands a beautiful (and undisputed) diagonal, while Black's c8-bishop, covering squares of the same colour, is hemmed in by the e-pawn.</p>

<p>Very good! Black strikes at the pawn formation in the centre and gives his queen access to the queen-side.</p>
<p>This freeing move of the c-pawn is of the greatest importance in queen's pawn openings.</p>

<p>“Move only one or two pawns in the opening!” say all the authorities, but no principle must be followed uncompromisingly.</p>
<p>This move permits White to meet the advance <b>...c4</b> by <b>Be2</b>, keeping the bishop lined up against Black's kingside. In the event that pawns are exchanged on d4, White can recapture with the e-pawn and free his c1-bishop.</p>

<p>An odd-looking sortie. Not only does this knight block the paths of the queen and a bishop, but also the piece itself seems to be doing little good. Yet, an expert would make this move without a moment's hesitation! For one thing, the knight adds us weight to the pressure on the strategically important c4-square, the springboard of the coming attack. For another, it is mobilized once it gets off the back rank. Finally, it can hop out of the way of the queen and the bishop when it is expedient for it to do so.</p>

<p>Black brings another piece into play (remember that the bishop is doing a job once it leaves the back rank) and prepares to get his king into safety by castling.</p>

<p>This is the sort of move instinctively made by a beginner. Its purpose is to chase off an annoying piece from its favourable post. The move is weak because it releases the pressure on White's centre. Tension must be maintained if Black is to have something to say about affairs in this vital area.</p>

<p>With this recapture. White's pieces that were crouched in the background spring into play.</p>
<p>White has the initiative and a commanding position in which to exercise it. If no immediate attacking opportunities present themselves, he can quietly put on more pressure by <b>Qe2</b>, <b>Re1</b>, <b>Bf4</b> (or <b>Bg5</b>) and <b>Rad1</b>, and wait for Black's game to crack.</p>

<p>Why an exclamation mark for a simple threat which is so easily countered? Why glorify this move when Black can not only save the pawn but also cause White to lose time? Black simply moves the h-pawn one square, rescues the pawn, and forces White's knight to retreat.</p>
<p>The answer to these questions is that White's purpose with his brilliant knight move is to compel one of the pawns defending the king to step forward.</p>
<p>The secret of conducting a successful kingside attack is to create a breach in the cordon of pawns surrounding the enemy king; to induce or force one of the pawns to move. The change in the line-up of pawns fixes the defence with a permanent weakness.</p>

White's attack appears dangerous. However, it is preferable to Black's actual move, which slops the queen coming any closer, but alters the pawn configuration. This change in the pawn formation saddles Black with a weakness that is organic, and one that can turn out to be fatal.</p>
<p>All this is encouraging to White, but how does he proceed? How does he exploit the weaknesses in Black's position? Above all, what does he do about his knight which is still under attack? Shall it retreat abjectly?</p>
<p>Before moving the knight back to f3 mechanically and unthinkingly. White looks carefully at the situation The opportunity to strike a decisive blow may be here at this very moment, but one hasty 'obvious move' may give Black just enough breathing time to reorganize his defences.</p>
<p>This is the position, and here is how White reasons out his attack:</p>

<p>The key point must be Black's g-pawn, which guards his king from invasion. If anything happens to this pawn - if it is captured the defence crumbles, and I can break into the fortress. How do I go about removing it from the board?</p>
<p>The g-pawn is protected by the f-pawn; suppose I destroy its support by sacrificing my knight for the f-pawn? After

, and I have two pawns for my knight, with a third one in sight, as the h-pawn must tall. Material is then approximately even, but his position is completely broken up, and clinching the win should be easy.</p>
<p>This might be the general plan, but before putting it in motion, White analyses the combination for possible flaws and comes up with this: after

<p>Clearly this line of play is too dangerous. Is there another way to break through, without letting Black's rook come into the game? Can I get rid of the f-pawn without disturbing the rook? It is important that I remove this pawn, as it supports the g-pawn and the e-pawn. Wait a minute! There is a clue in the last sentence. The f-pawn, guarding two other pawns, is serving two masters. Obviously it is overworked! I must add to its burden by luring it away from its present important post! Therefore:</p>
