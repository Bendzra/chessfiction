, when Black has two pieces in play to one of White's. This amounts to taking the initiative away from White early in the game.</p>
<p>The text-move is far more effective than random development of the knight, for instance at h3, where it is out of touch with affairs in the centre, or at e2, where it blocks all traffic.</p>

<p>The logical way to meet the attack on the pawn; a minor piece develops toward the centre and defends the pawn.</p>
<p>The general plan of mobilization is to establish a pawn in the centre, develop the minor pieces (the knights before bishops, whenever feasible), then castle to get the rooks to the centre files, and finally bring the queen out but not too far from home. Premature development of the queen is dangerous, as it is subject to annoying attacks by pawns and minor pieces.</p>

Black regains the pawn, but the pressure on Black is constant, and the threat is always in the air.</p>
<p>The Ruy Lopez is probably the strongest of all kingside openings. White has more to say in the centre, since he will he able to play <b>d4</b> with out much trouble, while Black will find it difficult to achieve <b>...d5</b>.</p>

<p>This can become like the story The House that Jack Built: the pawn attacks the bishop that attacks the knight that defends the pawn that the knight attacks.</p>
<p>Black's purpose is to dislodge the bishop from its favourable position. The loss of time involved in moving a pawn is compensated for by the fact that the threatened bishop must also lose a move in retreating.</p>

<p>This is in the spirit of the opening as it maintains pressure on the knight. The alternative withdrawal to c4 is inferior, as the same position could have arisen after the move <b>3.Bc4</b>, except that here Black has the additional move <b>...a6</b>, which can only be to his benefit.</p>

, not with the idea of winning a pawn, as White regains it easily, but in order to obtain a tree, open game. The danger in this line is that it leaves Black's position in the centre somewhat insecure.</p>
<p>The text leads to a more blocked position, difficult to break through, but requires patience on Black's part.</p>
<p>The bishop's development at e7 is satisfactory even though it has moved only one square away from home. The important thing is that it has left the back rank and facilitated castling.</p>

<p>To prevent the pin <b>...Bg4</b>, which might embarrass the knight and the piece it shields, the queen. Both pieces are needed for the protection of the d-pawn and the maintenance of the pawn formation in the centre.</p>
<p>An exchange of the white knight by <b>...Bxf3</b>, and the recapture by the queen, removes at one stroke two supports of the d pawn.</p>
<p>Is White violating principle in moving one of the pawns near his king? Maybe, but one must know when to slight conventions as well as observe them. In this particular situation it is important to prevent an attack on the knight, its subsequent exchange and the break-up of White's pawns in the centre. The move of the h-pawn is weakening, but a lesser evil than would result from permitting the pin. But wait a moment! Is it a weakening move if Black is unable to benefit by it? Is it detrimental to the position if Black cannot exploit it by a kingside attack?</p>
<p>The answer is no! A move is weak only if the opponent can turn its imperfections to his advantage. The entire position is strong or weak only in relation to the position of the opponent. In this case, the move of the h-pawn is expedient as it conforms to the requirements of the specific position.</p>

, attacking the e-pawn a third time and threatening to double rooks on the file. This ought to be enough to beat down resistance if no quicker win is available.</p>
<p>Note that White has not embarked on dubious long-range combinations. His plan, in most cases aimed at increasing his positional superiority, is made for a few moves only. Don't believe all those stories you hear of chess masters analysing intricate combinations with dozens of variations for thirty moves ahead. They don't do this because they don't have to! It is far easier and more to the point to look only a few moves ahead and try to maintain at least an equal game at every stage. Winning by accumulating small advantages is more consistent with a common sense approach than to seek to overwhelm the opponent with bewildering combinations and venturesome sacrificial attacks. Strengthening one's own position gradually while undermining that of the opponent is more important than indulging in fruitless speculative fancies.</p>
