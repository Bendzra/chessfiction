<p>In this game, the art of chess is reduced to a simple formula: get a passed pawn, move it up the hoard, and win!</p>
<p>White begins by getting a foothold in the centre, while releasing two of his pieces.</p>

<p>This is probably Black's strongest reply. It equalizes the pressure and prevents White from monopolizing the centre with

<p>The knight leaps in toward the centre, intensifying the pawn's pressure on c5. The knight does its best work at f3, covering eight squares in the circle of its attack.</p>

<p>Black applies the same formula, developing his g8-knight to its most effective post. Aside from its admirable potential for attack, the knight also serves while it stands and wails. In the service of the king, especially after castling, the knight defends as no other piece can.</p>
<p class="longNotation">

</p>
<p>Not the most energetic procedure, but White need not be aggressive from the start. The opening itself is so strong that White can build up a promising position merely by developing his pieces so that they occupy the most suitable squares immediately. The method is simplicity itself:</p>
<p>Put every single piece to work, and move no piece twice until development is complete.</p>
<p>The fact that
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3", this, "e2e3"); ' class="line1">3.e3</span> 
releases one bishop but shuts in another is of little moment, as the c1-bishop can get into the game by way of b2. White does not indicate his specific intentions: he might play the Colle Attack or perhaps simply develop the bishop at d3 with a view to early kingside castling.</p>

<p>Black supports his d-pawn, anticipating an attack on it by
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3 0 4", this, "c2c4"); ' class="line1">4.c4</span> 
. He prefers this to the alternative pawn support by <b>3...c6</b>, which confines his queen's bishop.</p>
<p>However, if Black wants to free his bishop, why not move it at once to f5? There it would stand ready to oppose White's bishop when it moves to d3. The almost inevitable bishop exchange then removes White's attacking bishop from the board and takes the sting out of the Colle system of attack.</p>
<p>Another possibility was pushing on to c5 at once with his pawn, striking at White's centre, and opening the c-file for the use of his own heavy pieces. But why play

<p>White defends the f3-knight with a minor piece, relieving the queen of a duty. This method of developing the knight is preferable to placing it at c3, where it might interfere with the future operations of the queen or the rook on the c-file.</p>

<p>For Black's knight, too, this is model development. At d7 it cooperates with the f6-knight and supports an eventual attack on White's centre by <b>...c5</b> or <b>...e5</b>. Hither of these freeing moves is an objective Black must strive to attain in this opening.</p>
