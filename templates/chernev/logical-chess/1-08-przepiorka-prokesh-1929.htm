<p>One reason for the popularity of queen's pawn openings is that from the very first move they present problems for the defender. There is no method by which Black can seize the initiative or even equalize in a hurry.</p>
<p>Despite its inherently positional nature, the queen's pawn appeals tremendously to attacking players and has always been a favourite weapon of such aggressive spirits as Alekhine, Keres, Pillsbury, Bogoljubow, Spielmann and Colle.</p>

<p>The knight develops toward the centre, where he has the greatest freedom of action and the widest scope for his activities.</p>
<p>The knight possesses the peculiar property of being able to attack any other piece (except another knight) without being under attack in return This attribute makes it a fascinating piece to manoeuvre about the board.

<p>White begins the concentration of pressure on e4, essential in the Colle. Generally speaking, it is a good plan to mobilize the pieces on the king-side first, to enable early castling on that side.</p>

</p>
<p>This move is almost indispensable in queen's pawn openings. It is important not to play first, as Black's c pawn must not be obstructed.</p>
<p>Black's move strikes at the centre and establishes a state of tension in that area</p>

, White can recapture with the c-pawn and open the diagonal for the c1-bishop.</p>
<p>It may seem that White's last move denies the b1-knight his best square, but in this form of attack the knight belongs at d2.</p>

<p>This is probably superior to placing the knight at c6. At d7, the knights are in touch with each other, so that if the f6-knight is exchanged the other can get to f6, an ideal square for attack or defence. At d7, the knight keeps clear of the c-file. The more open the tile is, the more useful will it be for the queen or rook that occupies it. Finally, should White play

<p>White secures the safety of his king before starting any decisive action. It is dangerous to open up the position and leave the king in the centre where it is exposed to a possible counterattack.</p>

<p>Black's castling is a defensive measure. But why give the king's permanent address when White has revealed that he is preparing an assault on the kingside? It would be better strategy to keep the opponent in the dark - delay castling for a while and continue developing the pieces (which surely can do no harm). Black might bring his queen to c7, with a view to an early <b>...e5</b>, and then fianchetto his c8-bishop (<b>...b6</b>, followed by <b>...Bb7</b>)</p>

<p>After the text-move, White has accomplished what he set out to do: he has forced the advance of the g-pawn. But how does he exploit the resulting weakness? Is there an attack against the pawn? Apparently there isn't, as in order to strike at it with the h-pawn, he must move the rook out of the way, and then play <b>h4</b> and <b>h5</b>, a process which takes time and achieves little.</p>
<p>What other line is there? Sacrifice a piece for the g-pawn? Obviously this is useless, as White still does not break through.</p>
<p>But the pawn did advance, and there is a weakness somewhere. We know this fact to be true, and in this fact there must be the clue to the winning combination.</p>
<p>The pawn's advance weakened the squares h6 and f6, as they are no longer guarded by the pawn. This means that White must try to get control of these squares, either seize and occupy them with his pieces, or use them as a means of penetrating into the enemy camp.</p>
<p>But wait! Doesn't Black's knight still guard the f6-square? Indeed it does, and this knowledge provides us with the information we need. The knight is the guardian of the dark squares, and the knight must be destroyed!</p>
