<p>Beginning the game with this pawn move releases two pieces at one stroke. This is as much as White can achieve in one move in the way of getting the pieces off the back rank and into play. The pawn itself plays an important part in the struggle for domination of the centre and the control of key squares.</p>

, recapturing with a pawn in order to maintain a pawn in the centre.</p>
<p>Black's second move has the merit of not shutting in the c8-bishop, as the alternative <b>2...e6</b> does. On the debit side though, if Black does develop his bishop freely, he must be prepared to beat off troublesome attacks on his d-pawn and his h-pawn, occasioned by the absence of the bishop. Another and more important consideration is that while the c-pawn standing at c6 represents a fine support for the d-pawn, it is not fulfilling its main purpose in life, which is to challenge White's control of the centre. It must be avail able to advance to c5 in order to attack White's d-pawn and to open the c-file for the use of Black's heavy pieces.</p>

<p>Why doesn't White play

and stifle his opponent completely on the queenside? These are some of the reasons he does not do so:</p>
<p>1) It is good strategy to maintain tension in the centre - to keep the pawn position fluid, not static.</p>
<p>2) In advancing to c5, White gives up his attack on the enemy centre, and the option of exchanging pawns when it is worthwhile to do so. Such an exchange might be the means of demolishing Black's whole centre!</p>
<p>3) The c5-square should be an outpost for a piece, not a pawn. A piece posted there exerts a tremendous effect on Black's whole queenside.</p>
<p>4) Placing a pawn at c5 closes the c file and makes it useless for the operations of the queen or the rooks.</p>
<p>5) In the opening, pieces, not pawns, should be moved.</p>
<p>All the foregoing explains why a chess master 'instinctively' finds the right moves. It is not that he can analyse twenty moves ahead, or that he bothers to examine the effects of every possible move. Sometimes he does not even look one move ahead! He saves time by dismissing from consideration any move which his instinct (or more accurately his experience and judgement) warns is contrary to principle and cannot possibly lead to favourable results. By discarding moves which offend his feeling for what is proper, by avoiding artificial expedients which are distasteful to his positional judgement, he plays stronger, sounder chess at ten seconds a move than does the average amateur in his serious tournament games</p>

<p>The bishop occupies a diagonal where it can operate with great effect, while the kingside is cleared for speedy castling.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, it is good policy to develop the kingside pieces first, so that the king can find safer quarters.

<p>Before White makes his next move, let us sum up his advantages:</p>
<p>• His pawn position in the centre, restraining the free movements of the enemy pieces, is definitely superior to Black's.</p>
<p>• His queen attacks nine squares while Black's is limited to five.</p>
<p>• His bishops control thirteen squares, whereas Black's are limited to seven.</p>
<p>• His knight enjoys wonderful mobility, while Black's knight can only retreat.</p>
<p>Clearly. White has established a definite positional superiority. His pieces have greater mobility, as simple arithmetic shows, and their power to attack is definitely greater than that of Black's army. White has earned the right to look tor a decisive combination that will exploit to the full his positional advantages.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see what form of attack will succeed in breaking through Black's strongly entrenched position.</p>
