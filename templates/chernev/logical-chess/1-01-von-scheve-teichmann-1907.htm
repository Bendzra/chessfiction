<h3>Game 1<br />von Scheve - Teichmann<br />Berlin 1907<br />Giuoco Piano</h3>
<p>The chief object of all opening strategy is to get the pieces out quickly off the back rank and into active play.</p>
<p>You cannot attack (let alone try to checkmate) with one or two pieces.</p>
<p>You must develop all of them, as each one has a job to do.</p>
<p>A good way to begin is to release two pieces at one stroke, and this can be done by advancing one of the centre pawns.</p>
<p class="longNotation">
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1", this, "e2e4"); ' class="line0">1.e4</span> 
 <span class="ellipsis0">...</span> 
</p>
<p>This is an excellent opening move. White anchors a pawn in the centre of the board and opens lines for his queen and a bishop. His next move, if he is allowed, will be

. The two pawns will then control four squares on the fifth rank, c5, d5, e5 and f5, and prevent Black from placing any of his pieces on those important squares.</p>
<p>How shall Black reply to White's first move? He must not waste time considering meaningless moves, such as
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/7p/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2", this, "h7h6"); ' class="line1">1...h6</span>

. These and other aimless moves do nothing toward developing the pieces, nor do they interfere with White's threat to monopolize the centre.</p>
<p>Black must fight for an equal share of the good squares. Black must dispute possession of the centre.</p>
<p>Why all this stress on the centre? Why is it so important?</p>
<p>Pieces placed in the centre enjoy the greatest freedom of action and have the widest scope for their at tacking powers. A knight, for example, posted in the centre, reaches out in eight directions and attacks eight squares. Standing at the side of the board, its range of attack is limited to four squares. It is only half a knight!</p>
<p>Occupation of the centre means control of the most valuable territory. It leaves less room for the enemy's pieces, and makes defence difficult, as his pieces tend to get in each other's way.</p>
<p>Occupation of the centre, or control of it from a distance, sets up a barrier that divides the opponent's forces and prevents them from cooperating harmoniously. Resistance by an army thus disunited is usually not very effective.</p>

<p>Very good! Black insists on a fair share of the centre. He fixes a pawn firmly there and liberates two of his pieces.</p>

<p>Absolutely the best move on the board!</p>
<p>The knight develops with a threat attack on a pawn. This gains time as Black is not free to develop as he pleases. He must save the pawn before he does anything else, and this cuts down his choice of reply.</p>
<p>The knight develops towards the centre, which increases the scope of his attack.</p>
<p>The knight exerts pressure on two of the strategically important squares in the centre, e5 and d4.</p>
<p>The knight comes into play early in the game, in compliance with the precept: develop knights before bishops!</p> <p>One reason for the cogency of this principle is that the knight takes shorter steps than the bishop. It takes longer for him to get to the fighting area. The bishop can sweep the length of the chessboard in one move (notice how the f1-bishop can reach all the way to a6). Where the knight takes a hop, skip and jump to get to b5, the bishop makes it in one leap.</p>
<p>Another purpose in developing the knights first is that we are fairly sure where they belong in the opening. We know that they are most effective on certain squares. We are not always certain of the right spot for the bishop We may want the bishop to command a long diagonal, or we may prefer to have it pin an enemy piece. So: bring out your knights before developing the bishops!</p>
<p>At this point you will note that Black must defend his e-pawn before going about his business.</p>
<p>There are several ways to protect the pawn. He must evaluate and choose from these possibilities:

. How does Black decide on the right move? Must he analyse countless combinations and try to visualize every sort of attack and defence for the next ten or fifteen moves?</p>
<p>Let me hasten to assure you that a master does not waste valuable time on futile speculation. Instead, he makes use of a potent secret weapon - positional judgement. Applying it enables him to eliminate from con-sideration interior moves, to which the average player devotes much thought. He hardly glances at moves that are obviously violations of principle!</p>
<p>Here is what might go through his mind as he selects the right move:</p>
<p>
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3", this, "f7f6"); ' class="line1">2...f6</span> 
: “Terrible! My f-pawn occupies a square that should be reserved for the knight and it also blocks the queen's path along the diagonal. And I've moved a pawn when I should be developing pieces.”</p>
<p>
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3", this, "d8f6"); ' class="line1">2...Qf6</span> 
: “Bad, since my knight belongs at f6, not the queen. Also, I'm wasting the power of my strongest piece to defend a pawn.”</p>
<p>
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnb1kbnr/ppppqppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3", this, "d8e7"); ' class="line1">2...Qe7</span> 
: “This shuts the f8-bishop in, while my queen is doing a job which a lesser piece could han-dle.”</p>
<p>
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/3b4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3", this, "f8d6"); ' class="line1">2...Bd6</span> 
: “I've developed a piece, but the d-pawn is obstructed, and my c8-bishop may be buried alive.”</p>
<p>
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3", this, "d7d6"); ' class="line1">2...d6</span> 
: “Not bad, since it gives the c8-bishop an outlet. But wait - it limits the range of the f8-bishop, and again I've moved a pawn when I should be pulling pieces to work.”</p>
<p>
 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3", this, "b8c6"); ' class="line1">2...Nc6</span> 
: “Eureka' This must be best, as I have developed a piece to its most suitable square and protected the c-pawn at the same time.”</p>

</p>
<p>Without going into tedious analysis. Black picks out the best possible move. He follows the advice of the Frenchman who said. “Sortez les pi&#232;ces!”. He brings a piece out and saves the c-pawn without any loss of time.</p>
<p>I would caution you that this and other maxims are not to be blindly followed. In chess, as in life, rules must often be swept aside. In general, though, the principles governing sound chess play do make wonderful guide-posts, especially in the opening, the middlegame and the ending!</p>

<p>“The best attacking piece is the king's bishop.” says Tarrasch, so White puts this piece to work and clears the way for early castling.</p>
<p>The bishop seizes a valuable diagonal in the centre and attacks Black's f7-pawn. This pawn is particularly vulnerable as it is guarded by one piece only - the king. It is not unusual, even early in the game, to sacrifice a piece for this pawn, so that the king in capturing it is uprooted, driven into the open and exposed to a violent attack.</p>

<p>Is this the most suitable square for the bishop? Let us look at the alternatives:</p>

: Not too bad, because the bishop looks out on two diagonals and is well placed for defence. At e7 the bishop has made only one step forward, but it has been developed once it has left the back rank. The important thing to remember is that every piece must be put in motion.</p>
<p>The strongest developing move is

. On this excellent square the bishop commands an important diagonal, exerts pressure on the centre and attacks a weak pawn. This deployment conforms to two golden rules for opening play:</p>
<p>Place each piece as quickly as possible on the square where it is most effective.</p>
<p>Move each piece only once in the opening.</p>

<p>A coffee-house move! Weak players make this move instinctively in dire dread of having a piece pinned.</p>
<p>It is better to submit to the pin - a temporary inconvenience - than to prevent it by a move that loosens the position of the pawns defending the king and weakens the structure per-manently. Playing <b>h3</b> or <b>g3</b> after castling creates an organic weakness that can never be remedied, as a pawn once advanced cannot retreat, and the position, once altered, cannot be restored. The pawn that has moved forward itself becomes a target for direct attack, while the square it guarded earlier (here it is <b>g3</b>) becomes a landing field for the enemy's troops.</p>
<p>“You should never, unless of necessity or to gain an advantage, move the pawns in front of the castled king,” says Tarrasch, “for each pawn move loosens the position.”</p>
<p>Alekhine expresses it even more strongly:</p>
<p>“Always try to keep the three pawns in front of your castled king on their original squares as long as possible.”</p>
<p>Black can now speculate on breaking up White's kingside by removing the h3-pawn, even at the cost of a piece. The recapture tears open the g-file and exposes White's king to attack. This plan is of course not to be put into action until more pieces are brought into play.</p>

<p>Much stronger than taking with the pawn. The knight on e5, beautifully centralized, radiates power in every direction (something a pawn cannot do).</p>
<p>The disappearance of White's d-pawn has benefited Black's bishop, hidden away at a7. Its range has been extended, so that it now controls the whole of the long diagonal leading to White's f2-pawn - and the king is just behind the pawn!</p>

<p>This looks plausible, as White gets rid of a powerfully placed piece, but in making this exchange. White's own f3-knight, the best defender of the castled position, also comes off the board. The importance of hold-ing on to the knight in such situations was pointed out by Steinitz more than seventy years ago, when he said, “Three unmoved pawns on the kingside in conjunction with a minor piece form a strong bulwark against an attack on that wing.” Tarrasch attests to the valuable properties of the f3-knight with a simple emphatic statement: “A knight at f3 [f6 for Black] is the best defence of a castled position on the kingside.”</p>

<p>Observe that White's knight has disappeared completely from the board, but Black's knight has been replaced by another piece.</p>
<p>This new piece, the queen, is magnificently posted at e5. She dominates the centre, bears down on the hapless e-pawn, and is poised for quick action on any part of the board.</p>
<p>How does White solve the problems posed by the position of the menacing queen and the attacks on his c-pawn? He would love to dislodge the queen by <b>12.f4</b>, hut unfortunately the move is illegal. Can he save the pawn?</p>

, and the pin wins the queen.</p>
<p>But Black is not interested in grabbing pawns. His positional superiority is great enough to justify looking for a combination that will conclusively force a win. His bishops exert terrific pressure on their respective diagonals (even though one bishop is still undeveloped!). Each of them attacks a pawn shielding the king. Black's queen is ready to swing over to the kingside, while the knight can leap in if more help is needed. Black controls the centre, a condition that. Capablanca says, is essential for a successful attack against the king. In short. Black is entitled to a winning combination as reward for his methodical positional play.</p>
<p>The question is: is there a target available for the explosion of this pent-up power?</p>
