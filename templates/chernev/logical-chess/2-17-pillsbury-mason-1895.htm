<p>White opens with one of the strongest possible first moves:</p>
<p>• The d pawn occupies an important square in the centre and at tacks two valuable points, e5 and c5.</p>
<p>• Control of these squares keeps the opponent from making use of them for his pieces.</p>
<p>• The queen and dark-squared bishop can now leave the first rank.</p>
<p>• The king is safe from some of the surprise attacks that occur in king's pawn openings. These come about when Black develops his f8-bishop at c5 and sacrifices it for White's f2-pawn to force the king out into the open and subject him to assault by the other pieces.</p>

drives the queen off and leaves White dominating the centre.</p>
<p>The offer of a pawn has as its purpose the removal of Black's d-pawn from its fine position in the centre. This offer, unlike the one in the King's Gambit, involves no risk. White regains the pawn easily and retains an advantage. It is in effect an exchange of a flank pawn for Black's centre pawn. The point of playing
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3 0 2", this, "c2c4"); ' class="line1">2.c4</span> 
so soon is that it disputes the centre at once, without endangering the safety of the king.</p>
<p>There is also another purpose - a strategic one. An exchange of pawns must come, sooner or later, resulting in the opening of the c-file. Ownership of this file is of paramount importance in the Queen's Gambit. White generally tries to get full possession of it by posting his queen at c2, and developing his queen's rook at c1.</p>
<p>Control of this tile and of the c5-square on this file is equivalent to control of the game. Of such peculiar significance is this c5-square that it is almost enough simply to plant a piece securely there to get a paralysing grip on Black's game.</p>

, and White wins a pawn) and Black's kingside pawn position is shattered.</p>
<p>The opening thus far had been given sporadic earlier trials by various players, but Pillsbury was the first to appreciate its enormous winning possibilities. He pictured the bishop move (most masters brought the bishop quietly into the game at f4) as a sort of Ruy Lopez on the other side of the board! With this particular sequence of moves, which he perfected and popularized, he achieved some remarkable victories, notably in his debut at the Hastings 1895 tournament.</p>
<p>In this game, we see him applying the great power of the Queen's Gambit to crush an opponent who is not familiar with its fine points and who puts up less than flawless defence. He beats Mason 'like a child' as Marshall used to express it.</p>

<p>If nothing else, the development of the bishop anywhere furthers Black's progress, as the decks are cleared for kingside castling. At e7, the bishop is happily placed for defence, and, if the need arises, can be transferred quickly to a more aggressive position. Incidentally, the knight is unpinned and White's threat nullified.</p>

<p>In queen's pawn openings the king's knight's job is the control and sometimes the occupation of the outpost e5. In fact, entrenching the knight at this square and supporting it solidly with the d-pawn and the f-pawn is the motif of what later came to be known as the Pillsbury Attack, a tremendously effective assault on the kingside.</p>

<p>At first glance, this seems to be a simple and natural way to develop the c8-bishop, as it is hemmed in on the other side by the e-pawn. It look many years, and a great many losses by Black, to discover that an early fianchetto of the bishop was not an easy solution to the problem of the bishop's development.</p>
<p>After a great deal of trial and error. a reasonable defence was hit upon, which consisted of playing <b>...dxc4</b> at an early stage, followed after suitable preparation by an attack on White's d-pawn by <b>...c5</b> or <b>...e5</b>. The first of these moves (<b>...c5</b>) is intended to dispute control of the centre, open the c-file for the use of Black's pieces and in general free his cramped position. The attack by <b>...e5</b> is meant to take away the control of e5 from White's d-pawn, and to open a diagonal for Black's c8-bishop.</p>
<p>In short. Black first puts up a fight for the centre before he thinks of developing the bishop.</p>
<p>It is of almost vital importance that Black play <b>...c5</b> sooner or later. This move strikes at White's d pawn, establishes tension in the centre, opens the c-file for his own major pieces and frees the crowded position on the queenside. Failure to make this move permits White to seize control of the c-file and the c5 square. Should White manage to post a piece on that square, it will exert terrific pressure on Black's entire-position, and this one factor alone may be enough to cause Black's downfall.</p>

<p>This disposition of the knight is characteristic in queen's pawn openings. The knight must not go to c6, blocking the c-pawn. The pawn must be free to advance and challenge the centre.</p>

<p>The two most effective squares that White's queen can occupy in this opening are e2 and c2 At c2, the queen supplements the rook's action in exploiting the c-file, while in another direction guards the strategically important e4-square from invasion by Black's f6-knight.

<p>Blissfully unconscious of the impending danger, Black goes about his business, which in this ease consists of bringing the knight over to attack, and perhaps to occupy e4.

<p>White has declared his intention of piling up as much pressure as possible on the c-file and on the c6-pawn. Black must meet that threat by bringing all his resources to bear for defence of the file, or institute a counterattack vigorous enough to divert White's forces from the assault.</p>
