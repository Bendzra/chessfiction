<p>In his delightful book Chess for Winter Evenings, written more than 140 years ago. H.R. Agnel proposed an interesting argument for the superiority of

“Moving the d-pawn two squares,” he said, “gives the queen a range of two squares and the c1-bishop a range of five squares. But moving <b>1.c4</b> gives a range of four squares to the queen and five squares to the f1-bishop. You see therefore that e-pawn two squares is the most desirable move with which to open the game. There is another reason why this move is desirable -the pawn occupies a portion of the centre of the board. Two pawns abreast at your c4- and d4-squares, supported by pawns and pieces, must be considered as your best military position, and maintained with all the skill in your power.”</p>

<p>The knight develops and gains a tempo by attacking the queen.</p>
<p>One of the drawbacks of Black's system of defence is that it subjects his queen to harassment by the minor pieces without her being able to bother them in return. The queen, for example, cannot threaten to capture a knight that is protected as that amounts to giving up the queen for a knight. The knight, though, can attack and threaten to capture the queen, whether the queen is protected or not.</p>

<p>Answer: by another pin! Apparently, Black is not interested in routine defence, or for that matter in normal development. He wants his pieces to rush out of their corners lighting. If this strategy is sound, what is to become of all the principles of development - the precepts which in the hand of a master are his greatest weapons?</p>
<p>So far, Black has violated the conventions governing proper development, by these acts:</p>
<p>1) he has brought the queen into play too early;</p>
<p>2) he has moved the same piece twice in the opening;</p>
<p>3) he has developed bishops before knights;</p>
<p>4) he has launched an attack before completing his development.</p>
<p>The question is: can he get away with all this?</p>

<p>One of the points a beginner learns painfully is that he must fight for control of every bit of territory, whether it is a tile, a diagonal or a square It is often necessary to offer an exchange of pieces to secure possession of an important point or area. Such offers must not be avoided for fear of their leading to a dull game, or that such strategy is unsportsmanlike. The player with a material advantage who temporizes because he wants to win brilliantly, and avoids exchanges because they are dull and unsportsmanlike, is only torturing his opponent.
