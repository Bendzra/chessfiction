<p>One of the best moves on the board! A pawn occupies the centre, and two pieces are freed tor action.</p>
<p>One hundred and fifty years ago the great Philidor said, “The game cannot better be opened than by advancing the e-pawn two squares.” This advice is still good today.</p>
<p>Only one other white first move,
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3 0 1", this, "d2d4"); ' class="line1">1.d4</span>

<p>“Probably the best reply,” says Capablanca.</p>
<p>Black equalizes the pressure in the centre and trees his queen and a bishop.</p>

<p>This is superior to such developing moves as

<p>Black must defend his pawn with

<p>In disturbing the position of the pawns shielding his king. White weakens organically the structure of the kingside castled position and sets up the unfortunate h-pawn itself as a convenient target for direct attack.</p>
<p>All chess theorists affirm the validity of the concept of leaving the kingside pawns unmoved, from Staunton, who said more than a hundred and forty years ago, “It is seldom prudent in an inexperienced player to advance the pawns on the side on which his king has castled.” to Reuben Fine, who said a century later, “The most essential consideration is that the king must not be subject to attack. He is safest when the three pawns are on their original squares.”</p>
<p>How does Black take advantage of White's last move? What is the best way to expose its imperfections?</p>

</p>
<p>By playing a move similar to the one I have severely censured!</p>
<p>What is the justification for Black's advance of the h-pawn?</p>
<p>Black has not weakened his defensive position, since his king is not castled on the kingside. His advance of the h-pawn is a gesture of attack, not a timid attempt to ward off a pin. The h-pawn will constitute a base for the g-pawn, which will march up to g5 and then g4. From there it will strike in two directions, at White's knight and his h3-pawn. White will be compelled either to capture this pawn or let it capture his own h3-pawn. No matter which exchange occurs, it results in an opening up of the g-file, along which Black can align his pieces for an attack on the king.</p>
