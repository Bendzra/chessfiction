<h2>The Chess Master Explains his Ideas</h2>
<p>Let us imagine ourselves sitting beside a master player who reveals his thoughts in the course of a game. We can then thrill to the excitement of combinative play and revel in the pleasure of watching ideas come to life. We can see how the tactical themes, the pin, the knight fork, the double attack and the mating combination (the sort of thing we could always spot if similar opportunities only presented themselves) are prepared for by the strategy of setting the scene for their appearance.</p>
<p>The games that follow are not primarily displays of pretty fireworks, nor do they feature explosive (and sometimes unpredictable) attacks. They may not conform to the popular concept of brilliancy, but they do show how circumstances can be shaped by iron control of the forces involved. They also show what can be accomplished by applying the three great principles that Capablanca advocated and himself utilized so successfully:</p>
<p>1) in the opening, rapid and efficient development;<p>
<p>2) in the middlegame, coordination of pieces;<p>
<p>3) in the ending, accurate and time-saving play.<p>
<p>These games are wonderful illustrations of the efficacy of Capa-blanca's principles in practical play.<p>
<p>In my book, games such as these are brilliancies.<p>
<p>In the game Capablanca-Mattison (<a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/3-24-capablanca-mattison-1929.htm' %}">No. 24</a>) White does nothing but develop his pieces, but it's enough to summon up all sorts of piquant little combinations. What makes the feat impressive is that all the combinations are in White's favour, right up to the threat of mate in one (a smothered mate), which is enough to persuade Black to resign. A Capablanca jewel!<p>
<p>Janowsky-Alapin (<a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/3-25-janowsky-alapin-1905.htm' %}">No. 25</a>) is undoubtedly the most beautiful game Janowsky ever played. His manoeuvring on the open d-file leads to the creation of a passed pawn The pawn must be blockaded, and Black shows ingenuity in shifting blockaders so that a weaker piece keeps replacing a stronger one. Then comes an interesting phase where Janow-sky's pawns reach out to the dark squares on the seventh rank, gripping them like so many fingers at the throat of an adversary. The finale includes an amusing shifting of attack to various files, which Black must try to imitate in defence.<p>
<p>“Etude on the Black Keys” might be a title for the Bernstein-Mieses (<a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/3-26-bernstein-mieses-1904.htm' %}">No. 26</a>) game. Bernstein fastens on the weaknesses of his opponent's dark squares and plants pieces in these holes in his position. After a remarkable tour by his king. Black's pawns begin to fall and a pathway is cleared for the advance of Bernstein's passed pawns.<p>
<p>Chekhover-Rudakovsky (<a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/3-27-chekhover-rudakovsky-1945.htm' %}">No. 27</a>) is an unknown masterpiece in which the themes we discussed in the first two sections of the book (Kingside Attack and the Queen's Pawn Opening) are beautifully blended. Black omits the freeing <b>...c5</b> move, a circumstance which his opponent immediately exploits. Chekhover, who controls the c-file, restrains and then blockades the enemy c-pawn. With Black tied up on the queenside, he switches the attack suddenly to the kingside, giving his opponent the job of defending on both wings, to say nothing of the centre. Black is forced to play <b>...g6</b> and weaken his dark squares f6 and h6 White's queen pounces on one of the weak squares. Then begins a series of mating threats on the kingside, which culminates in winning the queen on the queenside!<p>
<p>Tarrasch-Mieses (<a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/3-28-tarrasch-mieses-1920.htm' %}">No. 28</a>) is notable for Tarrasch's skilful refutation of a premature attack. His gains of tempo in the opening are carried over into the ending, so that what remains is a clear-cut demonstration of the technique for converting a pawn majority on the queenside into a passed pawn.<p>
<p>MarshalI-Tarrasch (<a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/3-29-marshall-tarrasch-1905.htm' %}">No. 29</a>) is a little-known masterpiece, which features a duel between a genius of attack and a virtuoso of defence. The methods of the positional player prove superior, his continual acquisition of territory driving White to the wall. Against Tarrasch's steady accumulation of positional advantages, any attack by his opponent seems futile.<p>
<p>There follow three games in which the motif is: get a passed pawn, move it up the board, and win! In the first, Capablanca-Villegas (<a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/3-30-capablanca-villegas-1914.htm' %}">No. 30</a>). White offers to sacrifice his queen, but where in most games such an offer is the high point of a combination, here it is subordinate to the grand strategy of securing a positional advantage It leads to control of the d-file, and this in turn is converted to a queenside majority of three pawns to two. Skilful play resolves this into a lone passed pawn, heavily blockaded, until another queen sacrifice opens wide the gates.<p>
<p>Havasi-Capablanca (<a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/3-31-havasi-capablanca-1929.htm' %}">No. 31</a>) is a superb specimen of positional play featuring the art of squeezing the most out of a tiny advantage. Capablanca secures a pawn majority on the queenside and sets to work to translate it into a passed pawn. This he does by getting control of the open c-file and then exploiting the weakness of his opponent's light squares. The rest consists of escorting the passed pawn safely to the queening square.<p>
<p>Canal-Capahlanca (<a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/3-32-canal-capablanca-1929.htm' %}">No. 32</a>) is a game for the connoisseur. Canal surprises Capablanca by a combination that wins two pieces for a rook. Or was it a surprise? Apparently Capablanca anticipated the combination and, looking further into the position than Canal, saw resources that were not revealed to his opponent. The ending that follows is a fascinating study and illustrates a 'domination' theme rare in actual play. There is a pawn to he queened, but it would take an eagle eye to find the particular pawn that will be crowned.<p>
<p>Rubinstein-Maroczy (<a href="{% url 'page-view' book.root_dir|add:'/3-33-rubinstein-maroczy-1920.htm' %}">No. 33</a>) is a splendid all-around performance. Rubinstein's economic development in the opening results in magnificent middlegame centralization, and this in turn is a prelude to a kingside attack in the ending. Not the least of this game's attractions is the remarkable use of d5 as a pivot for the manoeuvres of Rubinstein's knight, bishop, rook and queen, who each utilize this square in turn as a landing field!<p>
