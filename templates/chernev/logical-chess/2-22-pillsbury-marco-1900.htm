<p>Whether for fun, honour or blood, this is one of the best ways to begin the fight. Outlets are created for the queen and a bishop, while the d-pawn itself takes an active part in the struggle for control of the centre. It occupies d4 and stands guard over e5 and c5, making those squares unavailable for the opponent's pieces.</p>

<p>White offers a pawn in order to eliminate Black's strong point in the centre. It is necessary to play this move before developing the b1-knight at c3, as the c-file must not be obstructed.</p>

is not recommended policy. Black could not hold on to the extra pawn, so that in the end it would amount to exchanging a centre pawn for a side pawn. It is true that the text-move limits the c8-bishop's scope, but it is a necessary evil of what is probably Black's soundest defence. In this lies the great strength of the Queen's Gambit (for White) and its popularity with the majority of players who feel happy with an opening which lets them exert pressure from the very first move.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, although Pills-bury used this move to great effect in a magnificent victory over Tarrasch at Hastings in 1895, the comment on it by Gunsberg, who annotated the game for the tournament book, was, “No good results from this early sortie of the bishop. The attack, or perhaps better speaking, would-be attack differs from similar play in the French Defence, inasmuch as White has not the move <b>e5</b> at his command. Generally speaking, both the first and the second player in this opening require their queen's bishop on the queenside.”</p>
<p>This view, it turned out, easily qualified for 'the clouded crystal ball department'. Pillsbury utilized the attack stemming from

for some of his most marvellous triumphs, defeating such masters of the game as Steinitz, Maroczy, Janowsky,
Burn. Marco and Tarrasch. Others who evaded this line, such as Las-ker. Marshall and Chigorin (to name a few) fell victims to other forms of the Queen's Gambit. Gunsberg, who criticized this form of attack so severely, chose what Lasker called “a peculiar, but not altogether sound, manner of development”, with the result that Pillsbury defeated him in an ending which is one of the most beautiful in the literature of chess. In short, it was Pillsbury's great success with the Queen's Gambit that revealed its terrific strength to the other masters and gave it a popularity that has continued to this day.</p>

<p>“All this is very interesting.” you might say, “but how does White plan this scries of moves? What makes him look at even so much as the first move in the combination?”</p>
<p>Very well! Let's try to follow his line of reasoning:</p>
<p>White attacks the critical point. Black's h7-pawn, with queen and bishop.</p>
<p>If this pawn were protected only by the king. White could capture it and announce mate.</p>
<p>But the pawn has another protector, a knight.</p>
<p>How about removing the knight?</p>
<p>That would not do. It would only be replaced by another knight.</p>
<p>How about getting rid of the other knight? With that knight disposed of, wouldn't the whole structure collapse?</p>
<p>Once White thinks in this direction and sees the first move in the combination, the rest of it plays it-self. In fact, once he finds the key -removing the knight which protects the knight which protects against mate - he can win any way he pleases.</p>

<p>Black avoids being mated by making a simple pawn move. What then has White accomplished, if his mating combination can so easily be frustrated?</p>
<p>It is true that White has not inflicted mate, hut the threat of doing so has enabled him to achieve his real objective - a disturbance in the line-up of pawns near Black's king. This change in the pawn configuration weakens the entire defensive structure. After Black's actual move, his f6-knight, deprived of its pawn support, is a vulnerable object of attack, notwithstanding the fact that it is protected by three pieces.</p>

<p>Before White makes his next move, let us look at the object of his attack, the knight at f6. Although it has lost the protection of the g7-pawn, which has had to move to g6, it is still immune from capture, since it has a defender for every piece that attacks it. In fact, if White tries something like
