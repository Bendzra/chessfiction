<p>“Always deploy,” says Franklin K. Young, “so that the right oblique may be readily established in case the objective plane remains open or becomes permanently located on the centre or on the king's wing, or that the crochet aligned may readily be established it the objective plane becomes permanently located otherwise than at the extremity of the strategic front.”</p>
<p>If this is somewhat obscure (and I see no reason to believe otherwise) the conclusion it reaches is stated in limpid prose by the same writer: “The best initial move for White is

<p>You may play this confidently, se-cure in the knowledge that no master alive can make a better move.</p>
<p>• The knight develops in one move to its most suitable square in the opening.</p>
<p>• It exerts pressure on two of the four squares in the vital central area.</p>
<p>• It comes in toward the centre so that it enjoys maximum mobility.</p>
<p>• It helps clear the kingside, enabling early castling of the king on that side.</p>
<p>• It is posted ideally for the defence of the king after he castles.</p>
<p>• It comes into play with a gain of time - an attack on a pawn!</p>

<p>This is all very tempting, since the possibility of mating so early in the game is attractive to the young player, but such ambition should be suppressed. Premature mating attacks are usually repulsed with loss of time or material to the aggressor.</p>

<p>A pawn move when pieces should be brought into play? Yes, if the move is justified by the particular position. Black has four good arguments tor the pawn push:</p>
<p>1) He must drive off the bishop before he can advance his d-pawn (otherwise the king is in check).</p>
<p>2) The time lost in moving the pawn is compensated for by the fact that the bishop must also lose a move in retreating.</p>
<p>3) He opens a tine diagonal for his queen.</p>
