<p>A hundred and forty years ago, players began their games almost automatically with

has become equally popular. The queen's pawn openings lead to positions which are safe and sound. They offer security, and as additional inducement let White have a slight advantage right from the start.</p>
<p>With his first move, White occupies and exerts pressure in the centre with a pawn which is protected and simultaneously frees his queen and dark-squared bishop.</p>

<p>This move had the unqualified endorsement of Tarrasch. He held that Black had no better means of developing his pieces freely and easily, even if pawn exchanges in the centre leave him with an isolated pawn.</p>

<p>Black attains one of the objectives that motivated him to select the Tarrasch Defence. His queen's knight enjoys some influence in the centre, while the light-squared bishop (usually restrained by a knight at d7) is free and unrestrained</p>

<p>Black exchanges to give his pieces more scope (note the increased mobility of his dark-squared bishop) but this is not without its dangers. Open lines favour the player whose development is superior, and in this case it is White.</p>

<p>The recapture leaves Black with an isolated pawn in the centre of the hoard. Such a pawn must depend on pieces to defend it from attack, as there are no pawns on either side that can come to its support. Another consideration is that an enemy piece can be posted firmly on the square directly in front of the isolated pawn, in this case d4, without any fear of being driven off by a pawn.</p>
<p>All this is very discouraging, but in return for these shortcomings, the possessor of the isolated pawn is rewarded with open files and diagonals - room for the activities of his pieces. The pawn itself, in spite of its forlorn appearance, often becomes the spearhead that pierces and breaks up a fortified position.</p>
<p>The theorists themselves are not in complete agreement on the merits or dements of an isolated pawn. Many years ago. Philidor said in his Chess Analysed: or Instructions by Which a Perfect Knowledge of This Noble Came May in a Short Time He Acquired: “A pawn, when separated from his fellows, will seldom or never make a fortune.” For the defence, we have Tarrasch, who said. “He who fears possession of an isolated d-pawn should give up chess.” There are arguments for both sides:</p>
<p>• Black has in his favour: increased mobility for his pieces, possible outposts for his pieces at c4 and c4 (supported by the d-pawn) and open files for his major pieces (the e- and c-files).</p>
<p>• White has advantages in the fact that he can station a piece permanently at d4 and can keep Black busy warding off threats to the d-pawn Not that the pawn can easily be captured, since the number of pieces attacking it can always be equalled by the number of pieces defending it, but by virtue of the fact that the pawn needs constant care. White can switch the attack to another section of the hoard. Black must not only be prepared to fight back there but also keep in close touch with the weak pawn.</p>

<p>A suggestion White is delighted to fall in with! He relieves Black of the isolated pawn, but in return fixes him with other weaknesses. From now on White will forget about the d5-square and turn his attention to dominating d4 and c5 completely. By anchoring pieces on those squares he can prevent Black from advancing his d-pawn or his c-pawn. The effect of blockading these pawns will be to shut in all of Black's pieces behind the pawns.</p>

<p>You would expect this bishop to go to f4, where its range is long and where it does not obstruct the e-pawn's movements; or you might consider g5 where it cramps Black's game. These are good and natural moves, but they do not fit in with the strategic concept governing this position. Once there is a definite, logical plan to follow, we must play moves that conform to that plan, so that the improvement of our own position or the undermining of the opponent's is conducted systematically and not as a result of accidental circumstances. Development, at this point, must not be carried out for its own sake.</p>
<p>It may seem strange that control of one square can cause a position to collapse, but it is true. It is one of the fine points in the Queen's Gambit that such domination (resulting from Black's neglect to dispute the centre and also free his queenside by <b>...c5</b>) enables White to confine his opponent's pieces to a small area and drive them back step by step, while he (White) either starts escorting a pawn to the queening square or turns to the other side of the board and beleaguers the enemy king.</p>
