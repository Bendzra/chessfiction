<p>The most important target in the opening is to develop the pieces as last as possible in order to occupy and control the centre.</p>

<p>Black saves his e-pawn and develops a piece. The knight comes into play efficiently: its action is directed toward influencing the centre. It de-tends the e5-pawn and attacks d4.</p>

<p>The bishop comes out, taking up a post where it commands a diagonal leading towards Black's king. It attacks a pawn which is peculiarly vulnerable as it is defended only by the king.</p>
<p>This does not mean that White will capture the pawn in the next few moves, but the threat is always there. Many a short brilliancy owes its life to similar captures in which the bishop is sacrificed simply to draw the king out into the open where White's other pieces can get at him.</p>

<p>Black follows suit, bringing his bishop out to the most suitable square.</p>
<p>In the opening, a bishop is best placed for attack when it controls a diagonal passing through the centre or when it pins a hostile knight and renders it immobile. Defensively, the bishop would do a fine job at c7, where it radiates power in several directions, making an intrusion by an enemy piece difficult.</p>

<p>“Chess is not for timid souls,” wrote Steinitz in a letter to Bachmann. Castling early in the game is generally sound strategy. In this case it is inappropriate, as White's centre is formidable and must be destroyed. Black must play <b>7...Nxe4</b>, accepting the offer of a pawn, and take his chances of surviving whatever attack might follow. It cannot be worse than this passive castling, which results in both his knights being evicted from their fine posts. Pillsbury gave as his rule, which he said was absolute and vital: “Castle because you want to or because you must, but not because you can.”</p>
