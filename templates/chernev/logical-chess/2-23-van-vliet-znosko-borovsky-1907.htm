</p>
<p>The queen's pawn opening, to paraphrase George Bernard Shaw, “offers the maximum of security with the maximum of opportunity.”</p>
<p>With the first move. White occupies the centre with a pawn and trees two of the queenside pieces.</p>
<p>His general plan of development runs somewhat as follows:</p>
<p>He will establish and maintain at least one pawn in the centre.</p>
<p>This pawn will act as a support to a knight outpost at c5 or c5.</p>
<p>The bishops are to take charge of key diagonals or pin enemy pieces.</p>
<p>The rooks are to control the open or partly open files.</p>
<p>The queen should stand at c2 or e2, close to home but off the back rank.</p>
<p>The king should find safety in castling, preferably on the kingside.</p>
<p>Basically, White's aim is to gain space and crowd Black to the wall. With less room to move around in, and with the consequent difficulty of manoeuvring his pieces effectively. Black will be forced to weaken his position. He will have to make some poor moves, because good moves are not easily available in a cramped position. The weaknesses will come to light, and the opportunity to exploit them will come in the form of a combination, resolving the issue at one stroke.</p>

</p>
<p>This is a more forthright move than
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2", this, "g8f6"); ' class="line1">1...Nf6</span> 
. Either of these moves prevents White from playing

and establishing two pawns in the centre. The text-move offsets White's pressure in the centre and creates a state of equilibrium there.</p>

 <span class="ellipsis0">...</span> 
</p>
<p>A strangely passive move in an opening where every single moment counts.</p>
<p>Usually, White strikes at Black's d-pawn by
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3 0 2", this, "c2c4"); ' class="line1">2.c4</span> 
to weaken his grip on the centre. Or, if White does not want to show his hand too soon, he simply develops a piece by
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2", this, "g1f3"); ' class="line1">2.Nf3</span>

</p>
<p>So Black takes the initiative and plays this all important freeing move. It opens the c-file for the use of the rooks and gives the b8-knight more scope by letting it come out at c6. The c-pawn itself puts up a fight for possession of the centre by its attack on White's d-pawn.</p>

<p>A rare opportunity for this knight, who seldom gets good breaks in queen's pawn openings. From its post at c6 the knight brings considerable influence to bear on e5 and d4 and, as it later turns out, on another important sector.</p>

</p>
<p>White has made four out of five moves with pawns in order to secure a particular arrangement known as the Stonewall Attack. Aside from the fact that making so many pawn moves in the opening is a flagrant violation of principle, the adoption of a system which calls for the launching of an attack by a preconceived formation of pieces, without regard to the advisability of an attack and without reference to the requirements of the particular position, is contrary to the concept of proper strategy and to the spirit of chess itself. What such an expedition amounts to is undertaking the risk of assuming the offensive against an enemy whose force is equal, whose line-up of power is unknown and who has betrayed no vulnerable points. Under these conditions, an attack is premature and is sure to be repulsed and turned into a disorderly retreat. If any such system worked, it would be fine for White, who would always win, but then who would want to play Black?</p>

<p>An excellent development while awaiting developments! Both Black's knights are poised beautifully, with one watching over e5 and d4, while the other keeps the two remaining central squares under observation.</p>

<p>This knight has the unhappy choice of making its entrance at this square or at a3. At d2, it blocks the bishop and itself has no bright prospects in view. At a3 it is only half a knight, since it reaches at most in four directions instead of eight.</p>

<p>Very good, since the heavy pieces (the queen and the rooks) fulfil their functions best when placed on open files, or files likely to be opened.</p>

<p>Routine and in this case thoughtless development. White is so intent on carrying out the basic theme of the Stonewall attack (posting of a knight at c5, stoutly supported by pawns) that he fails to stop at every move to ask himself, “What does my opponent threaten with his last move? Has he any checks or captures that cut down my choice of reply?”</p>

<p>After this recapture, a survey shows the inferiority of White's position:</p>
<p>The bishop is undeveloped, preventing communication between the rooks.</p>
<p>The pawn cluster in the centre is completely immobilized.</p>
<p>All the pieces are still on the first rank.</p>
<p>Aside from the features of this particular position, it is important to appreciate the peculiar strength with which a rook is imbued when it dominates (as Black's does) the seventh rank:</p>
<p>• It attacks the pawns still remaining on the rank, striking all along the line, so that defending them is difficult.</p>
<p>• The rook can get behind pawns that have moved off the rank and maintain constant pressure, since the pawns are always under attack by the rook, no matter how far up the file they move.</p>
<p>• The rook restrains the enemy king from coming out to take a hand in the ending, by guarding the line of exit.</p>
<p>The moral is:</p>
<p>In the opening, shift the rooks toward the centre, on files likely to be opened.</p>
<p>In the middlegame, seize the open files and command them with your rooks.</p>
<p>In the ending, post your rooks on the seventh rank Doubled rooks on the seventh rank are almost irresistible in mating attacks. If there is little material left on the board, the seventh rank is a convenient means of manoeuvring a rook behind enemy pawns.</p>
