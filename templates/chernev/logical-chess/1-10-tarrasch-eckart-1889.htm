<p>This opening move makes an outlet for two pieces, the queen and light squared bishop. It does more than that.</p>
<p>It frees a square for the king and gives an extra one to the g1-knight. It is true that the knight is best developed at f3, but there are times when it is expedient to bring it to e2 - perhaps to reach f5 by way of g3. It is just as well to add to the knight's freedom of movement, if no lime is lost thereby. As to the king, there's no harm in letting him have a bit more breathing space too. Many a king has been smothered by a lack of consideration, or by carelessness.</p>
<p>Consider this case history, from a minor tournament: McGrouther-McCann. Dundee 1893.

, this move does release two pieces and has the advantage of restricting White's choice of attack. White no longer has the whole range of Open Games at his disposal, and he is less able to steer the game into highly tactical channels by adopting an opening such as the King's Gambit.</p>
<p>The French Defence conceals a great deal of potential dynamic energy and is a fine weapon against an over-enthusiastic attacking player. Black's position is not easily assaulted despite its cramped appearance.</p>

<p>As strong as it is natural. Of this pawn formation, Staunton, in the nineteenth century, said, “It is generally advantageous for your pawns to occupy the middle of the board, because when there they greatly retard the movements of the opposing forces. The e-pawn and the d pawn at their fourth squares are well posted, but it is not easy to maintain them in that position, and if you are driven to advance one of them, the power of both is much diminished.”</p>

<p>Black attacks the e-pawn while giving his queen more mobility.</p>
<p>It is important to dispute control of the centre.</p>

</p>
<p>White has two reasons for developing the knight at d2:</p>
<p>• He wants to avoid the knight being pinned, as might occur after
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3", this, "b1c3"); ' class="line1">3.Nc3</span> 
.</p>
<p>• He is prepared, in the event of an attack on his d pawn by <b>...c5</b>, to reply <b>c3</b>, supporting the centre.</p>
<p>Should pawns be exchanged on d4, he recaptures with the c-pawn and keeps a pawn in the centre It is true that his c1-bishop is blocked, but this condition is only temporary. Pieces can get out of each other's way.</p>

</p>
<p>If followed up correctly, there is nothing wrong with this move. The idea is that by attacking the e4-pawn, Black aims to force this pawn forward to e5. As Staunton explained above, once White's two central pawns do not stand abreast, his whole central structure is weakened.</p>
<p>An alternative and equally good plan was to light for control of the centre by
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6 0 4", this, "c7c5"); ' class="line1">3...c5</span> 
, incidentally permitting his queen the use of another di-agonal and access to the queenside.</p>

 <span class="ellipsis0">...</span> 
</p>
<p>Why does White disregard Staunton's advice about keeping two pawns on the fourth rank? He knows that the pawn may be weaker at e5, but he weighs strengths and weaknesses. At e5 the pawn drives the knight away from its most useful post and sends it off to another square where it interferes with the free movements of Black's other pieces.</p>
<p>Clearly, the value of this or any other move is arrived at by balancing the benefits it confers against any disadvantages that might accrue.</p>

<p>One of those rare times when the knight belongs here instead of at f3. It is true that f3 should be occupied by a knight, and White will arrange to have one there. His plan is to swing the knight from d2 to f3, meanwhile freeing his c1-bishop.</p>

<p>Another plausible move, but far too passive. Black's position is cramped by the chain of enemy pawns on d4 and e5, and he should not allow this situation to persist. He must try to break White's grip on the centre to obtain more space for his pieces. The correct continuation was

. Then the problem with the d7-knight blocking in the c8-bishop has been resolved, and the disap-pearance of the c5-pawn means that Black has gained the d6-square for the development of his dark-squared bishop. If Black does not take the necessary liberating action, then he is likely to be gradually squeezed to death. Such a fate befell even so great a player as Capablanca in his game with Alekhine at AVRO 1938. As a consequence of his inferior opening play, Capablanca was tied up so badly that he could not stir and that he resigned with nearly all his pieces still on the board.</p>
