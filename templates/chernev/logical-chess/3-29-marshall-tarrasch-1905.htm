<p>Although queen's pawn openings are played with the idea of obtaining an early positional advantage. Marshall considered the best way to start an attack was to begin the game with
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3 0 1", this, "d2d4"); ' class="line1">1.d4</span> 
. One reason for his view might have been that the e-pawn openings no longer could be depended on to lead to wide-open games with opportunities for combinative play. In the old days when White began with

, the reply almost automatically was

. White could then offer a pawn by

, rely on its being accepted, and joyfully swing into the excitement of a King's Gambit. In taking the pawn and grimly holding on to it. Black gained material, but the loss of time involved threw him on the defensive Gradually, after sustaining many defeats, the players of Black tired of being the victims of brilliancies. They took a more rational attitude, and grew cautious. They resorted to

or

, steering the game into channels of their own choosing. The result was that an aggressive player, starting the game with

, found himself facing 'irregular' defences, which forced the game into unfamiliar channels. He found himself involved in tightly knit positions requiring systematic planning, when he was itching to get an attack rolling. He was supposed to have the initiative, hut here it was wrested away from him! How could he play a gambit (even at best a risky matter) if his opponent did not oblige him with a forthright

in answer to his own enterprising

<p>In beginning the game with

</p>
<p>Undoubtedly one of the strongest replies. Black stabilizes the pressure in the centre, prevents White from strengthening his hold there by

</p>
<p>Taking the pawn is perfectly sound, but why give up the centre to win a pawn which it turns out you cannot keep? Playing
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3", this, "d5c4"); ' class="line1">2...dxc4</span> 
is equivalent to exchanging a centre pawn for a side pawn, in itself an unprofitable transaction. However, many leading players are happy to play this opening, so there must be some counterbalancing plus points. The main advantage is that Black no longer has the responsibility of supporting the d5-pawn, and this makes it easier for him to organize the crucial thrust <b>...c5</b>, exchanging his own c-pawn for White's d-pawn. Thus, although White has a temporary superiority in the centre, it is often not long before Black can restore a symmetrical central situation.</p>
<p>After Black's actual move, his d-pawn is firmly supported. If now

, Black recaptures with a pawn, maintaining a pawn in the centre.</p>
<p>It is true that Black's c8-bishop is shut in by the c-pawn, making its development difficult, and this is a drawback to the defence. But if Black's first two moves are good, and they probably form the best reply to the Queen's Gambit, then one can appreciate the terrific strength of this opening, and why so many players adopt
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3 0 1", this, "d2d4"); ' class="line1">1.d4</span>

<p>Tarrasch did not approve of this knight move, which most of us would make instinctively It is true that f6 is the most useful square for the king's knight 99.44% of the time, since from there it influences affairs in the centre strongly, enjoys great freedom of movement, and is magnificently placed for attack and defence. However. Tarrasch feared the strength of the pin that White can clamp on the knight next move. Instead of
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4", this, "g8f6"); ' class="line1">3...Nf6</span> 
, he therefore recommended that Black challenge White's centre at once by
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6 0 4", this, "c7c5"); ' class="line1">3...c5</span> 
(the advance <b>...c5</b> is almost a must at some stage in queen's pawn games), meanwhile opening up the c-file for the use of his own heavy pieces.</p>
<p>Why then, you may ask, did Tarrasch play a move that he himself disparaged? His explanation is that this was the first game of a match against one of the world's leading masters (Marshall had recently won the Cambridge Springs tournament without losing a game, ahead of Lasker, Schlechter. Pillsbury and Janowsky) and he did not wish to stray so soon from orthodox paths.</p>

<p>Naturally! Not only because the bishop exerts uncomfortable pressure on the knight, but also because it is good policy to play moves that the opponent finds disturbing, it Tarrasch thinks that pinning the knight is troublesome - pin the knight and make him uneasy!</p>

<p>This looks clumsy, with the knight blocking what little view the c8-bishop had, but pieces can easily step out of each other's way. The knight belongs on d7 and not on c6, where it obstructs the c-pawn. This pawn must not be hindered from advancing sooner or later to c5. Little as the pawn is, it represents a major force in disputing possession of the centre!</p>

Black sets a little trap for the unwary, invented by Tarrasch. If White, relying on the impotent state of Black's pinned knight, tries to pick up a pawn by

<p>This sort of pawn move is not a waste of time. Without a liberating pawn move the bishops can never get off the ground, so this is part of the process of bringing the pieces into play.</p>
<p>With the text-move. White opens two diagonals at once, one for his f1-bishop and another one for the queen. The e-pawn contributes an additional service in bracing up the pawn-centre.</p>

<p>It is customary to develop the minor pieces first, roughly in this order:</p>
<p>First the knights, generally to c3 and f3, but toward the centre in any event; then the bishops (after the necessary pawn moves), either to control vital diagonals or to pin enemy knights; following this, it is time for the queen to make her entrance. If the queen comes into the game too early, she incurs the danger of being harassed perhaps even surrounded and captured - by enemy minor pieces.</p>
<p>Last come the rooks, which after castling are brought to c1, d1 or c1, to head tiles in the centre which are partly open These files are likely to become completely open after pawn exchanges in the centre.</p>
<p>This method of development is not by any means to be considered a fixed course to pursue. Nothing in chess - no convention, principle or recommended procedure - is to be practised rigidly. The value of any single move or combination of moves can only be measured with respect to the particular position on the board. It must fit in with the scheme of the game you are playing and be tempered by the demands of the opponent. A great deal depends on what he does, or lets you do. This is why you may find it expedient to develop the queen at the sixth move or to castle at the sixtieth move.</p>

, pinning the c3-knight and then increasing the pressure on it. It might have been more to the point for White instead to mobilize another minor piece by

<p>A many-sided move: the queen not only unpins the f6-knight but starts a counteraction by pinning the white knight; Black threatens to intensify the pressure by bringing the f8-bishop to b4. As an extra, added attraction. Black sets a little trap to catch the careless - and this might even include expert players who at times treat the opening in a perfunctory way. The trap might snap shut on a player who innocently develops his bishop at d3 only to find that

attacks his queen and wins a bishop.</p>
<p>It might be as well to state at this point that Tarrasch did not expect to catch Marshall with such a primitive trap. Master players do not set traps if it involves injuring their own position.

<p>“In his anxiety,” says Tarrasch, “to guard the threatened bishop. White makes a decisive mistake.”</p>
<p>This is an interesting example of the value of accurate liming in chess. The fact that a normal developing move has intrinsic strength is secondary to the question of its usefulness in the one position in front of you, not in vaguely similar positions.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the knight occupies a most useful post at f3, and at the same time protects the bishop, its development is either too soon or too late. White is doing nothing about the problem of his pinned knight. This is where pressure is exerted; this is where danger is threatened.</p>

, the knight is adequately guarded since it is attacked three limes and defended three times. However, Black then capitalizes on a curious fact about the power of a pinned piece: not only is it helpless to make a move but it has also lost its ability to defend! Translated into chess language, this means that

. Black's method is classical in its simplicity. He follows up by <b>...Bxc3+</b> and after the recapture by the pawn exchanges queens. He has an extra pawn, but this is not enough advantage to bring about checkmate. He must increase his material superiority sufficiently to justify him in going after the king, and this can only be done by turning one of his pawns into a queen. So he selects the most likely candidate, in this case the passed a-pawn, and pushes it step by step up the board The pawn's advance faces the opponent with a problem that becomes more acute with every step taken by the pawn. He must head off the pawn or blockade it completely, in either case tying up one or more of his pieces to do so. The defence is under the strain of keeping the pawn under constant surveillance, while at the same lime having to guard against a sudden switching of the attack toward his king. What often happens is that he cither has to give up a piece for the pawn or allow further exchanges of pieces, a procedure which leads to inevitable loss.</p>
