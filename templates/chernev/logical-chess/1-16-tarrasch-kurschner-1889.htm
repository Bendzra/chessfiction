is that the pawn standing in the centre is protected. It is safe from attack, whereas in openings starting with
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1", this, "e2e4"); ' class="line1">1.e4</span> 
, the e-pawn is more vulnerable.</p>
<p>In queen's pawn openings, with the queen firmly backing up the cen-tre pawn. White dictates the tempo. He has the initiative and keeps it for a long time against any defence, any line of play that Black may select. Right from the start. White is given the opportunity to build up his position, with little danger of being bothered by a counterattack, while Black struggles to achieve equality. If Black plays timidly - if he fails to dispute the centre by <b>...c5</b> at some stage - his queenside pieces, especially the c8-bishop, will be badly cramped and unable to develop decent activity. If he develops carelessly - moving the same piece several times in the opening or bringing his bishops out before the knights - punishment will come swiftly.</p>
<p>The purpose of chess being to win, not to entertain the gallery with pretty pictures on the chessboard, it is no wonder that many players prefer the 'dull, safe Queen's Gambit' to the romantic but risky adventures of the kingside gambits.</p>
<p>I venture to say (and this opinion has forty years of research behind it) that the queen's pawn openings have contributed as many masterpieces and as many genuine brilliancies as did any of the kingside openings.</p>

<p>Black's idea with this capture is to avoid the constricted positions that are normally his lot in the Queen's Gambit Declined, but in doing so he has given up a beautifully centralized pawn for a less central one.</p>
<p>Accepting the gambit is perfectly sound, but the resulting play requires great care on Black's part. Above all, he must not hold on to the extra pawn for too long.</p>

<p>By this, Black hopes to solve the problem of the shut-in c8-bishop, one of the evils the defence is heir to. However, the solution is not quite so simple! The bishop's absence from the queenside weakens that section of the board and leaves the b-pawn vulnerable. Another drawback in Black's move is that it violates one of the precepts for sound development:</p>
<p>Bring out your knights before the bishops!</p>
<p>Instead of the text-move. Black's best bet is in counterattack, viz.:

<p>Why does White move his queen instead of getting his knights out?</p>
<p>His purpose is to punish Black for faulty development. Black's play has not been normal procedure, and the way to take advantage of his sins is not with routine moves.</p>
<p>White's move, developing a piece with a threat (
 <!--span onclick='loadMove("rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/5b2/2BP4/1Q2P3/PP3PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 6", this, "d1b3"); ' class="line1">5...z0</span-->

<p>This looks attractive, since Black protects his b-pawn, and at the same time threatens to play

, winning a rook.</p>
<p>Black's move, however, is abnormal and a serious infraction of the opening principle which states:</p>
<p>Move each piece only once in the opening: place it at once on the square where it exerts most power and where it has the greatest freedom of movement.</p>

 <span class="ellipsis0">...</span> 
</p>
<p>This move is justified on more than one count. Not only does it parry a threat in an economical way, but it also forces Black to lose a move in the retreat of his bishop. Incidentally, the pawn at f3 will firmly support a later advance of the e3-pawn.</p>

<p>Now we see the results of the bishop's ill-timed expedition. It stands at c6, depriving the b8-knight of its natural square of development in the opening. Worse yet, it obstructs the c-pawn. If this pawn cannot get to c5 to dispute control of the centre and to open the c-file for Black's pieces, there is a danger that Black will be smothered.</p>

<p>“But the knight belongs on f3!” you must be protesting. So it does, but if it cannot develop at f3, get it into the game somehow! Move it, if only to get it off the back rank! Of course, the same comment applies to the other three knights, too.</p>

<p>Anything else loses material.</p>
<p>Before making his next move. White must decide whether to continue bringing pieces into play or to try exploiting his present lead in development. Thus, he pauses to take stock before committing himself to a definite course of action.</p>
<p>He has a pawn stationed at d5, which at first glance is doing an excellent job. It prevents Black's b8-knight from developing at c6, keeps the d7-bishop from coming to e6, and restrains the f6-knight. The pawn does this single-handed, but at a price! In standing at d5 it occupies a square that should be reserved for pieces. Pieces have more mobility than pawns and can attack more readily. Pieces can utilize d5 as a jumping-off square, a point of departure to any part of the board In fact, the wretched pawn does a disservice in obstructing the diagonal of the bishop and the supporting queen and takes up room on a file which should be open! Belter that the d5-square be vacant than that a pawn block traffic there! (And in this last sentence, as we shall see, is the key to White's problem).</p>
<p>What about Black's prospects?</p>
<p>With the exception of the f6-knight, his pieces are confined to the first two ranks. His position is a bit crowded, but if he gets a chance to castle and reorganize his forces, it will be hard to subdue him.</p>
<p>White must not allow him time to do this. White must not dawdle!</p>
