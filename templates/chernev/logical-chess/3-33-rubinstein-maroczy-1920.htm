<p>This opening move, seizing the centre with a pawn and making room for two pieces to come out, is efficient. White intends to develop all his pieces as quickly as possible, posting each of them in one move on its most suitable square. He will make only those pawn moves that speed his development (by releasing pieces or attacking the centre) or hinder that of his opponent.</p>

<p>White develops the kingside pieces first, to enable early castling on that side. At f3, the knight stands on its most useful square in the opening. It is beautifully placed for attack - notice how it supplements the pawn's grip on c5 - and is a peerless defender of the kingside after White castles.</p>

<p>Black cannot wrest the initiative by brute force. He may get it if White plays carelessly (wasting time in the opening or chasing after pawns) hut against normal development Black must content himself with achieving equality.</p>
<p>Black's second move neutralizes White's central pressure and opens lines for two of his own pieces.</p>

<p>One of the rare occasions when a pawn move which does not aid development is opportune. This one attacks and threatens to eliminate, by <b>4.cxd5</b>. Black's centre. It does additional service in increasing the mobility (actual and potential) of White's pieces It clears a diagonal tor the queen and assures the opening of the c file for the later use of the queen or a1-rook.</p>

</p>
<p>This move has a terribly cramping effect on Black's game. It clamps a pin on the knight and thereby exerts pressure on any pieces behind it. Black cannot move freely about while his kingside is gripped by the bishop.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, White would more often have developed the dark-squared bishop at f4, where it commands a useful diagonal. Nowadays we look for sharper, more vigorous moves. If we can mobilize our forces and at the same time restrain the enemy's development, we accomplish more than with routine, often innocuous, measures. The pin of the knight paralyses Black's only developed piece.</p>
<div class="chessBoard analysis nobuttons" data-start-fen="rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4"></div>

</p>
<p>Why all the fuss when the pin is so easily lifted? For one thing, in unpinning the knight, the bishop is restricted to a defensive, passive role. Its development has been dictated by the fact that White put pressure on the knight.</p>
<p>Black's play, incidentally, is in no way to be deprecated The bishop's move, modest as it is, is a step forward in the process of development. The bishop has left the last rank, taken up a strong defensive post, and cleared the kingside, enabling Black to castle.</p>

<p>Pawns should be moved sparingly in the opening, but since some pawns must be moved to get the bishops into play, this must be regarded as a developing move.</p>

</p>
<p>In the Queen's Gambit Declined, the ideal square for the development of the b8-knight is not c6 but d7. From d7, the knight supports an eventual thrust at White's centre by the c-pawn or the c-pawn.</p>
<p>The knight must not develop at c6, where it blocks the c-pawn. This pawn must not be prevented from advancing to c5, where it can dispute control of the centre.</p>

<p>Black transfers his king to a more secure location and brings his h8-rook closer to the centre files.</p>

<p>The rook develops where it has the most attractive prospects for attack. At c1 it controls and will exert pressure all along the open c-file. The file is obstructed now by White's own knight and pawn, but the pawn can be disposed of by an exchange and the knight can move and clear the file. Strictly speaking, the file is only partly open, but open or not, the rook goes to c1 because:</p>
<p>Control of the c-file is absolutely vital in the Queen's Gambit.</p>

</p>
<p>Black's rook moves to a centre file, where it may play a useful part in any action that takes place in the centre. The rook's presence on the file is of little consequence now, but with every clearance on the file, its influence grows stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>Black's game is cramped, but alternatives aimed at freeing it immediately are not convincing:</p>

<p>Rubinstein prefers this to <b>11.cxd4</b>, which maintains a pawn, but one that is isolated, in the centre.</p>
<p>The weakness of a pawn separated from its fellows lies not so much in the fact that the pawn can only be defended by pieces, but in the peculiar circumstance that enemy pieces can settle themselves on the square directly in front of the pawn (in this case d5) and stay there indefinitely, secure in the knowledge that no enemy pawns can drive them away.</p>

<p>An extremely attractive move! These are all the things the pawn does:</p>
<p>1) It occupies a square in the centre.</p>
<p>2) It opens a path for the c8-bishop.</p>
<p>3) It cuts down the scope of White's g3-bishop.</p>
<p>4) It will drive off White's knight from its centralized position.</p>
<p>Against this. Black's move offers one objection, seemingly a slight one. The d5-square, no longer under the pawn's control, has been weakened. It offers White the prospect of utilizing this central point for the easy manoeuvring of his pieces to any part of the board.</p>
<p>Will this one liability outweigh all the assets? It is this judgement of imponderables, where exact calculation is not possible, that makes chess a fascinating blend of art and science.</p>

, the great master visualizes an exchange as an opportunity to substitute another piece for one that must come off the board. White is willing to exchange, but only if he can be assured of keeping control of d5 by replacing the bishop with another piece</p>
<p>Let me reword this, so that the message is unmistakable:</p>
<p>Supporting a piece under attack (here the bishop at d5) puts more pressure on Black, where a direct exchange or a retreat might relieve it.</p>
<p>Note incidentally the full effect of the queen's magnificent centralization, and her radiation of power in so many directions:</p>
<p>1) The queen supports the bishop at d5.</p>
<p>2) The queen adds to the bishop's attack on the b-pawn.</p>
<p>3) The queen helps in the attack on the c-pawn.</p>
<p>4) The queen threatens (indirectly) Black's b4-bishop.</p>

<p>Black rids himself of one troublesome piece only to have another one lake its place! For the third time. White anchors a piece at d5, each time intensifying his grip on the position.

<p>White has the superior position, but how does he break through?</p>
<p>Let us listen in on what Rubinstein might say to himself in reasoning out a course of action:</p>
<p>My rooks are as well placed as they can be and doing a good job in controlling the open d-file. My queen is strongly centralized and exerts pressure in every direction. My bishop hears down on his e-pawn and keeps a rook and knight chained to its defence. My pieces are all usefully occupied and must stay where they are.</p>
<p>How about my opponent? His defence just about holds together, but his pieces must stay where they are to guard his weak points. If I leave him alone, he might consolidate his forces, and even counterattack.</p>
<p>If I leave him alone...</p>
<p>Say, isn't that the key to the position?</p>
<p>I must not leave him alone! I must interfere with the arrangement of his pieces. I must drive them off from their present positions. In tact. I might ruin his game by driving off even one defender!</p>
<p>Since my pieces are all useful where they are. I must not disturb them but look to my pawns to break up the defence. Which pawn shall I use, and which of his pieces shall I try to dislodge?</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to find a target. His queen and rooks are too tar away and too agile to be bothered by pawns. Any of them can move off to a different square on a file or a rank and still control it. I must aim at a fixed target - some piece that is needed at the spot where it is stationed and loses its effectiveness as soon as it is displaced. How about the knight? Suppose I played

? It would have to leave its line defensive position immediately. Where could it go? If to c7, it blocks the action of the e8-rook, and if it retreats to the back rank, it is out of play for a time. Besides. I get another benefit in moving the h-pawn. It gives my king a flight square, so that he doesn't fall into a surprise mate on the first rank.</p>

<p>Simple and strong! The queen makes a powerful entrance at d5, seizing control of a diagonal leading to the king and at the same time tripling heavy pieces on the open central file. Notice the admirable use of d5 as a pivot for the manoeuvring of the various pieces. It has been occupied in turn by knight, bishop, rook and queen aptly enough, in order of strength!</p>

<p>How many of these variations did White foresee? And how many did Black know he was avoiding when he moved his knight to f8 instead of to c7?</p>

<p>A spectacular move! White is not playing to the gallery in offering a queen sacrifice. All that he wants is to penetrate still deeper into the heart of Black's position, and this is the simplest way to do so. The move is brilliant nevertheless, and making a move of this sort (even vicariously) gives one a thrill.</p>
<p>I must warn the player who likes the excitement of springing a surprise move on his opponent that it is a waste of time to look for brilliant moves in the course of a game unless the position warrants it. You must first get an advantage, however slight. Work on increasing the advantage until you have built up a position that is definitely superior. Once you have established your right to look for combinations, the brilliant moves will come of themselves.</p>
