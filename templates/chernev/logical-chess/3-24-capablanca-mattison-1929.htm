<p>The popular impression of king's pawn openings is that they offer all sorts of opportunities for whipping up a quick attack. A variety of gam bits can be played, pieces may be sacrificed to open lines, combinations ventured on, and speculation indulged in - anything for the sake of mate. Sometimes these tactics succeed, but very often the gambit player finds himself at the wrong end of the attack, as wide-open positions are as dangerous for one side as for the other.</p>
<p>In queen's pawn openings, the ideal to strive for is development for its own sake. The attack is not the be-all and end-all'. It is not deliberately played for, but, strangely enough, the very fact that all the pieces are developed economically, that they are put to work as quickly as possible on the squares where they function best, seems to imbue them with marvellous powers of attack. Combinations come into life out of nothing! Can it be that the simple posting of pieces where they have the greatest freedom of movement and the greatest command of the board generates in them so much dynamic energy that it must be released somehow? And can it be that knowledge of this fact is what makes the virtuosi of positional play repress their instinct to attack until the time is ripe for an attack to be unleashed?</p>
<p>White's move of the d pawn begins the process of getting all the pieces into play as quickly as possible. Two of them are now free to make their debut, while the pawn that released them occupies the centre of the stage.</p>

<p>There is a prevalent concept that in the opening there is a 'best move' at every point. The belief is that the chess master memorizes every one of these best moves and its proper reply. That such reasoning is specious is obvious: the very fact that millions of games have been played without duplication of moves is proof enough in itself.</p>
<p>Let us consider the position on the board. Besides the text-move (
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 4", this, "d1c2"); ' class="line1">4.Qc2</span>

. Which of these is best? No one can say for sure, but the move that leads into positions congenial to your style is the best move, and the one you should play.</p>

<p>Black too can conduct the defence (or the counterattack) in the manner that suits his style and temperament. The move he plays immediately disputes White's control of the centre. It does other things, too: it gives the queen more scope, opens the c-file, protects the bishop, etc.</p>
<p>However, there are other moves, equally effective, at Black's disposal. He can select from these replies, each of which has something to recommend it:

<p>Strongest for various reasons:</p>
<p>White does not lose time in taking the pawn, as Black in recapturing will return the lost tempo. The open d-file resulting from

<p>Somewhere about this stage, the amateur wants things to happen. He begins to look around for surprise moves. “There must be a brilliancy in the position!” The great master, in the same situation, is content to make simple moves. He knows that it he keeps on bringing pieces into play, there will be no need to look for winning combinations. They will evolve naturally out of the position and spring up all over the place!</p>

<p>Black spies a chance to start an attack which will result in saddling White with an isolated c-pawn - a slight positional weakness, so he begins an action against the knight, but “such artificial manoeuvres,” says Tartakower, “can hardly succeed against a Capablanca.”</p>

<p>1) it activates a piece, by getting it off the first rank;</p>

<p>Another of those subtle moves, whose purpose the average player usually fails to see. “What use is it,” he says, “to waste a rook move in attacking a pawn that is adequately protected?”</p>
<p>True, the pawn is defended, but by a bishop which cannot develop without abandoning the pawn. Sooner or later. Black will be compelled to play <b>...b6</b>, or have three pieces on his first rank interfering with each other. There are drawbacks to <b>...b6</b>, though, for example Black's queen will be cut off and prevented from returning to the kingside and the defence of the king. In addition, his c6-knight's position will be insecure, once the prop (the b7-pawn) is removed from under it.</p>
<p>White's move is simple and quiet, but it exerts uncomfortable pressure on Black's queenside, makes normal development difficult, and creates permanent weaknesses which lend themselves to exploitation.</p>
