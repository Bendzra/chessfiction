<p><b>Diagram 1</b>. The Classical Variation</p>
<p>In the Classical Variation White just concentrates on developing his pieces to sensible squares.
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 6", this, "f1e2"); ' class="line1">6.Be2</span>

as the latter interferes with the protection of the weakest point in the white camp, the d4-square.</p>
<p class="notification message">NOTE: The d4-square is slightly weak because having played e4 and c4 this square can no longer be protected by pawns.</p>
<p>In many variations of the King's Indian Black will form a plan whose aim is to occupy or control this square. Although the d4-square is weak, or potentially weak, that does not mean that White has made a mistake playing the moves e4 and c4 as they have given him a powerful centre and a space advantage. Chess is all about give and take. This is by far the most important variation in the King's Indian. That is why it takes up four of the ten chapters in this book.</p>

<p><b>Diagram 2</b></p>
<p>This is an important move. Black stakes his claim in the centre. At first sight it may appear that White can just win a pawn but you can read all about this in the Exchange Variation below. The alternatives deserve a quick mention.</p>

is played sometimes by those who fear the exchange of queens. It is however a lot less flexible and after

is an alternative strike in the centre but Black will have to be willing to play a Benoni after

. Very few players play the King's Indian in order to play

is a solid line which aims to exchange the bishop for the knight on f3. The idea of this is to slacken White's control of d4. Again it is not really in the style of the King's Indian. A real King's Indian player will preciously guard his light-squared bishop until he can sacrifice it on h3.</p>
<p>After
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ e6 0 7", this, "e7e5"); ' class="line1">6...e5</span>

and this is the subject of the next three chapters. This chapter deals with the alternatives:</p>

- the Exchange Variation</p>

 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 7", this, "d4d5"); ' class="line1">7.d5</span> 
- the Petrosian System</p>

 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 7", this, "c1e3"); ' class="line1">7.Be3</span> 
- the Gligoric System.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>1) The Exchange Variation deserves all the stick I have given it. I have nothing against exchanging queens and trying to win an endgame, but only when it is positionally justified. Here it certainly isn't.</p>
<p>2) The Petrosian System is a much more serious alternative to <b>7 0-0</b> and a genuine way for White to play for an advantage. However, most players believe it is a little premature for White to block the centre.</p>
<p>3) The Gligoric System is a dangerous line which has plenty of high level support. The line with <b>9 Bh4</b> is more dangerous than <b>9 Bc1</b>.</p>
