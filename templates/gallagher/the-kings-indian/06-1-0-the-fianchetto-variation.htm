<p><b>Diagram 1</b>. The Fianchetto variation</p>
<p>The Fianchetto Variation is characterized by White developing his king's bishop to g2. It is one of the most popular lines against the King's Indian at grandmaster level, especially amongst players from the former Soviet Union. It is a solid line where it is difficult for Black to obtain active play by the standard means we see elsewhere in this book. In fact the normal plan of attacking on the kingside is simply no longer viable, at least in the early stages of the game. Firstly, because the bishop on g2 affords extra protection to the white king and secondly because, unlike in other lines, White has no intention of blocking the centre. Attacking on the wing is a risky business when the centre is fluid. White's basic plan in this variation is to stifle Black's active play and gradually use his space advantage.</p>
<p>Before moving on, you should be aware that certain players prefer to transpose into a Gruenfeld when White plays the Fianchetto variation. The Gruenfeld is, basically, a King's Indian where Black plays

</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>1) The Gallagher Variation is a very sharp line which is based as much upon psychology as anything else. The players who play this line with White like to feel they are in control of the situation. They don't mind complications , but in their own time after they have built up their position first. They are not especially fond of the chaos that can arise from the word go in this variation.</p>
<p>2) <b>8...a6</b> has become a very respectable line. At the moment it looks like one of the best ways for Black to play against the Fianchetto.</p>
<p>3) The Panno Variation can also lead to extremely complex double-edged games after both <b>8 d5</b> and <b>8 h3</b>. Theoretically speaking, Black is struggling to prove equality.</p>
