<p><b>Diagram 1</b>. The ever-popular Saemisch</p>
<p>Look at the following list of names: Botvinnik, Tal, Petrosian, Spassky, Karpov, Kasparov, Kramnik. What do they have in common? Yes, they are all post war World Champions and yes, they are amongst the greatest players ever to hail from the USSR (Russia). The other thing they have in common is that they have all played the Saemisch! Many more names can be added to the list (Korchnoi, Shirov etc), so it is clear that the Saemisch is a high class variation which needs to be treated with respect. Having said that, its popularity is no longer what it used to be. I see it as the Grand Hotel of the King's Indian - an imperial variation that is slightly over the hill. That is not meant to be cruel to the Saemisch, as I play it myself quite often, but it has clearly slipped a long way behind the Classical in the King's Indian popularity stakes. It is currently vying for second place along with the <b>Fianchetto variation</b>.</p>
<p>The Saemisch owes its name to the German Grandmaster <b>Fritz Saemisch</b>. He is also famous for a line in the Nimzo-Indian -

<h4>What are the ideas behind the move

?</h4>
<p>1) It defends e4 so creates a secure and stable centre.</p>
<p>2) With his centre so stable White can start an attack on the kingside. <b>Be3</b>, <b>Qd2</b>, <b>Bh6</b>, <b>g2-g4</b> and <b>h2-h4</b> are typical moves when White wishes to carry out this plan. On other occasions White may attack on the queenside. The Saemisch is a flexible variation which does not commit White to any particular course of action.</p>
<p>3) The move <b>f2-f3</b> secures the square e3 for White's bishop. It can now take up residence there without having to worry about <b>...Ng4</b>.</p>
<p>The move <b>f2-f3</b> also has certain drawbacks. "Ask the knight on g1 what he thinks of the move f3" was a famous comment from the Ukrainian Grandmaster and raconteur Eduard Gufeld. In return for having such a strong centre White accepts that his kingside development is going to be rather clumsy.</p>

<h4>What are the main ways to combat the Saemisch?</h4>
<p>Black has three distinct strategies:</p>
<p>(1) Black can strike in the centre in Benoni fashion with

. Over the last decade or so this has supplanted all other variations and become the main line of the Saemisch. This is the subject of Section 1.</p>

<p>(2) He can delay his central strike in favour of queenside play. The most common way to do this is to play

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>1) The Saemisch is one of the most important lines in the King's Indian. It is an aggressive system but also one in which White has a secure and solid basis.</p>
<p>2)

has dented the Saemisch's popularity somewhat in recent times. The pawn sacrifice is hardly ever accepted by White anymore. Because of this

is no longer automatically considered as the best move. Nowadays White plays

almost as often.</p>
<p>3) The other lines in the Saemisch have suffered a bit because of the popularity of

. However, the Panno remains an extremely rich variation full of complex play, while Black is still struggling to equalize with
