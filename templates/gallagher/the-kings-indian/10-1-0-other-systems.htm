<h2>10. Other Systems</h2>

<p>This chapter contains three other variations in the King's Indian that occur from time to time. They are not necessarily worse than any of the other lines, just less fashionable.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>1) The systems in this chapter are not inferior systems for White, as can be seen from the statistics, they are just played a bit less often than the others.</p>
<p>2) <b>5. Bd3</b> is a solid stem where White tries to reduce the impact of Black playing <b>...f7-f5</b>. It appeals to players who don't want to work too much as White usually plays the same initial moves against whatever Black does.</p>
<p>3) White's main idea with <b>5. Nge2</b> is to play <b>Ng3</b> and then advance his h-pawn. It is quite playable for Black to castle into this attack but he must take care about sacrifices on h5. Certain Black players prefer to delay castling to frustrate White's attacking ambitions.</p>
<p>4) The Smyslov system is an awkward line for Black if he insists on playing for <b>...e7-e5</b>, but a relatively easy ride if he plays <b>...c7-c5</b>.</p>
