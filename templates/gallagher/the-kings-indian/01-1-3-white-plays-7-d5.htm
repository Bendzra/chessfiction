<p><b>Diagram 9</b>. The Petrosian System</p>
<p>The Petrosian System is the name given to the variation where White blocks the centre and follows up with Bg5. It is named after one of the all time greats, the 1963-69 World Champion Tigran Petrosian. The current World Champion (well, at least one of them) Vladimir Kramnik also played this variation extensively in his formative years. The wily Armenian, as Petrosian was often called, was famous for his deep, strategic, and often negative play. His philosophy was to stop the opponent's threats before they even thought of them. The reason he played Bg5 against the King's Indian was to prevent Black from moving his knight on f6 and playing <b>...f7-f5</b>. Black can still arrange <b>...f7-f5</b> but only by playing some awkward-looking moves or making positional concessions. The variation was very popular in the 1960's and in its heyday certain people saw it as the refutation of the King's Indian. Its popularity didn't last and it slipped away into relative obscurity before enjoying a short renaissance period in the early 1990's.</p>
<h4>Why doesn't White play <b>7.d5</b> so often these days?</h4>
<p>The reason this line is not so popular anymore is that White has made a positional concession of his own. He has blocked the position before it was necessary.
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 7", this, "e1g1"); ' class="line1">7.O-O</span> 
or

keeps Black guessing as to White's intentions in the centre. In principle, White is not against blocking the centre but he expects Black to pay for this clarification of the position. Examples of payment are when Black plays <b>...Nc6</b> (Chapters 3 and 4) as then White can gain a tempo with d4-d5 and force the knight to an inferior square, or when Black plays the move <b>...Re8</b>. Then White often blocks the centre as the rook is misplaced on e8. It now belongs on f8 to support the advance <b>...f7-f5</b>.</p>
<p>Let's look at some moves after
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 7", this, "d4d5"); ' class="line1">7.d5</span>

</p>
<p>This is considered to be the most flexible response. Black plans to play <b>...Na6-c5</b> and doesn't want to be immediately kicked away by White playing <b>b2-b4</b>.</p>
<p class="notification message">NOTE: The idea of playing <b>...a5</b> to secure the c5-square for a black knight is seen throughout the book. This is one of Black's key strategical ideas in the King's Indian.</p>
<p>There are two other Black moves:
 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bq1rk1/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 8", this, "b8d7"); ' class="line1">7...Nbd7</span>

also gets a mention there.</p>
<p>
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbq1rk1/1pp2pbp/3p1np1/p2Pp1B1/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 8", this, "c1g5"); ' class="line0">8.Bg5</span>

</p>
<p>This is sensible. It is useful for Black to have the possibility of breaking the pin with <b>...g6-g5</b>, even if it is not always wise to employ it.</p>

<p><b>Diagram 10</b>. Breaking the pin</p>
<p>Black breaks the pin without resorting to the positionally suspect move <b>...g6-g5</b>. He plans to move his knight from f6 to h7 in order to create threats on the kingside. White's long term ambitions are on the queenside but he may have to play further consolidating moves on the kingside first. This strategically complex line is covered in <b>Mariano-Cvitan</b>.</p>
<h4>Theoretical?</h4>
<p>Nearly all the variations in the Classical King's Indian are theoretical and this is no exception. Black will need to know a good plan if he wants to get out of the opening with a playable position.</p>
<h4>Statistics</h4>

White scores an average 54%. If we take the main line of the Petrosian System (see previous diagram) White has scored 53% from around a thousand games. In the line from <b>Lyrberg-Bologan</b> where Black chases the bishop with <b>...g6-g5</b> White's score jumps to 58%.</p>

<p><b>Diagram 13</b>. A new diagonal for the bishop</p>
<p>The bishop is heading for e3. White must now decide if he is going to allow this move and live with the active bishop, to allow <b>...Be3</b> but exchange bishops, or to prevent it altogether. In general, White would prefer to avoid an exchange of bishops because this will weaken his control of the dark squares.</p>
<p>In this book you will often see phrases like 'White has complete control of the light squares' or 'Black dominates the dark squares'. I remember from my early days as a chess player that this can be a difficult concept to grasp. Basically, control of a colour complex usually happens when the opponent's bishop of that colour is missing and the central pawns are on the opposite colour to the missing bishop. For example, if White has pawns on f3, e4, d5 and no dark-squared bishop he can be said to be weak on the dark squares. If Black can then get his own bishop on this diagonal (g1-a7) then it can be said that he controls the dark squares. It can be so important that players are often willing to give up an exchange to achieve this control.</p>
