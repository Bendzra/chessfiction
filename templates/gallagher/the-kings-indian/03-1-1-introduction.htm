<p>In the previous chapter we saw various seventh move alternatives for Black. Now we are moving into the main line, the heart and soul of the King's Indian. By playing 7...Nc6 Black leaves White little choice but to close the centre. He is even willing to have his knight driven to the inferior e7-square in order to achieve this central clarification. The reason Black wants the centre closed is that he wants to attack on the kingside and this is not possible with a fluid centre.</p>

<h4>Why does White retreat a well developed piece?</h4>
<p>Well, now that the centre has been duly closed the players will have to look for active play on the wings. White's pawns on d5 and c4 give him a space advantage on the queenside so it is logical that he attacks on that side of the board. Black will attack on the kingside. However, there is not much chance of an attack until he seizes some space on this side of the board. This will be achieved by moving his knight from f6 and advancing the f-pawn. In order to preserve his central structure White would like to meet <b>...f7-f5</b> with <b>f2-f3</b>. Therefore he has to move his knight from f3. He doesn't have to move it at once but if he does so it prevents Black's most active move with the king's knight, <b>...Nh5</b>. That is the thinking behind
 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQNRK1 b - - 0 9", this, "f3e1"); ' class="line1">9.Ne1</span> 
(and
 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9", this, "f3d2"); ' class="line1">9.Nd2</span> 
).
There is an alternative plan for White. He can leave his knight on f3 and meet <b>...f7-f5</b> with <b>Ng5</b> and a subsequent <b>Ne6</b>. For example,
 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/1PP1P3/2N2N2/P3BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - b3 0 9", this, "b2b4"); ' class="line1">9.b4</span>

 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bq1rk1/ppp1n1bp/3p2p1/3Ppp1n/1PP1P3/2N2N2/P3BPPP/R1BQR1K1 w - f6 0 11", this, "f7f5"); ' class="line1">f5</span>

is the main line of the Bayonet Attack.</p>
<h4>
 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQNRK1 b - - 0 9", this, "f3e1"); ' class="line1">9.Ne1</span> 
or
 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9", this, "f3d2"); ' class="line1">9.Nd2</span> 
?</h4>
<p>So once White has decided to move his knight, the next question is where? Well, that is a matter of taste. After
 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQNRK1 b - - 0 9", this, "f3e1"); ' class="line1">9.Ne1</span> 
White often follows up with Nd3 which will make it easy for him to organise <b>c4-c5</b>. However, once <b>c4-c5</b> has been played it is not easy to find an offensive role for the knight on d3 so it usually retreats to f2 to help in the defence of his king. On other occasions White leaves the knight on e1 and tries to force through <b>c4-c5</b> with the help of <b>Be3</b>.</p>
<p>
 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9", this, "f3d2"); ' class="line1">9.Nd2</span> 
envisages a more aggressive role for the knight. Once White has played c5 this knight will move into c4 after which it will be perfectly placed to take part in the demolition of Black's queenside. The drawbacks to this approach are that it might not be so easy to achieve c5 without the help of this knight and that the kingside will have less protection against Black's attack. As I said both approaches are equally valid and
 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9", this, "f3d2"); ' class="line1">9.Nd2</span> 
is considered in the next chapter.</p>
<p>
 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bq1rk1/pppnnpbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQNRK1 w - - 0 10", this, "f6d7"); ' class="line0">9...Nd7</span> 
</p>
<p>Just like White before him, Black has a choice of knight retreats (he is going to play <b>... f7-f5</b>).
The alternative,
 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bqnrk1/ppp1npbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQNRK1 w - - 0 10", this, "f6e8"); ' class="line1">9...Ne8</span> 
, is less common for a couple of reasons. Firstly, on e8 the knight does not control the e5-square so White can contemplate variations based on f4. Secondly, the knight on e8 does nothing to slow down c4-c5. For example, after
 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bqnrk1/ppp1npbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R2QNRK1 b - - 0 10", this, "c1e3"); ' class="line1">10.Be3</span>

 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bqnrk1/ppp1n1bp/3p2p1/3Ppp2/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP2B1PP/R2QNRK1 b - - 0 11", this, "f2f3"); ' class="line1">11.f3</span>

White can play <b>c4-c5</b> next move without further preparation.</p>
<p>After
 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bq1rk1/pppnnpbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQNRK1 w - - 0 10", this, "f6d7"); ' class="line1">9...Nd7</span> 
White usually chooses between:
 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bq1rk1/pppnnpbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2NN4/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10", this, "e1d3"); ' class="line2">10.Nd3</span> 
and
 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bq1rk1/pppnnpbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R2QNRK1 b - - 0 10", this, "c1e3"); ' class="line2">10.Be3</span> 
. They each have their own section.
He can also play
 <span onclick='loadMove("r1bq1rk1/pppnnpbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N2P2/PP2B1PP/R1BQNRK1 b - - 0 10", this, "f2f3"); ' class="line2">10.f3</span> 
followed by <b>g2-g4</b> and this is found in the section on blocking up the kingside.
</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>1) This chapter is very heavily theoretical but there are general rules and strategies to help you through the maze.</p>
<p>2) The lines with <b>10 Nd3</b> are not seen quite as often as they used to be and a lot of players have forgotten the theory. I suspect White would score rather well if he studied this line carefully.</p>
<p>3) The lines where White blocks the kingside with <b>g2-g4</b> can be frustrating for Black but if he is patient and builds up his position then something usually turns up. A sacrifice on g4 or an invasion down the h-file are the ideal scenarios.</p>
<p>4) The lines with <b>10 Be3</b> are often quite thrilling. If you just want to improve your tactical skill, then you could do a lot worse than immersing yourself in these variations. The plan with ...Rf6-h6 can be highly rewarding. I have to admit that the coverage above has been slightly biased in Black's favour but it is a truly dangerous system.</p>
