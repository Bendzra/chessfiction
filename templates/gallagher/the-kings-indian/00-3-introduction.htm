<h3>Is the King's Indian the opening for me?</h3>
<p>If your attitude to playing Black in chess is to try and neutralize White's slight advantage by careful defensive play, then the answer is no. In that case you should be looking for a book on something like the Queen's Gambit Declined or the Queen's Indian. If, on the other hand, you are a bit of a risk taker, you want to battle for the initiative right from the start, launch counter-attacks rather than meekly reacting to the opponents threats and lure White into over-extending himself, then the answer is a resounding yes! If you choose to play the King's Indian you will also be in exalted company. The two greatest chess players of all time (arguably), Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov, have both been, at one time or another, big fans of the King's Indian.</p>
<p>
The King's Indian is, in fact, one of Black's most popular responses to 1 d4. The majority of variations in this book start after the moves

<p><b>Diagram 1</b>. The King's Indian Defence</p>
<!--/div-->

<p>White has been allowed to construct a large pawn centre while in return Black has taken the time to develop his dark-squared bishop to its potentially most active diagonal. This bishop is usually referred to as the King's Indian bishop and Black's progress is often closely tied up with the fortunes of this piece. When it becomes active it can be a wonderful piece that wins the game while, on other occasions, when Black mishandles the opening, it can end up as a truly miserable creature that costs Black dear.</p>
<p>White's dominance of the centre is only a temporary state of affairs, as once Black has castled he will stake his claim there by playing either <b>...e7-e5</b> or <b>...c7-c5</b>. His choice is usually determined by what White plays over the next couple of moves but, in general, King's Indian players prefer to play <b>...e7-e5</b>. In fact, there is little point in discussing general strategy any further in this Introduction as it can vary greatly from variation to variation.</p>
<h3>History and popularity</h3>
<p>Although the King's Indian was played occasionally in the 19th century it wasn't until the 1920's that it established itself as a regular opening. Even then it failed to make a real impression and it was only in the late 1940's that the King's Indian really took off. Much of the credit for this is due to the famous Soviet grandmasters David Bronstein and Isaac Boleslavsky who devoted much time and energy to the analysis of the opening. Other famous players who played their part in the development of the King's Indian were the Argentinian grandmaster Miguel Najdorf and the Yugoslav Svetozar Gligoric. Since then the King's Indian has enjoyed spells of great popularity and other periods of relative quiet. Chess fashion is often dictated by the champion of the day. When there is a champion who doesn't like to take too many risks then the quiet variations rise to the surface. This happened when Anatoly Karpov ruled the chess world from the mid-1970's to the mid-1980's. The popularity of the King's Indian declined during this period but when Garry Kasparov took over in the mid-1980's there was an explosion of interest in this opening.</p>
<p>The King's Indian has long been popular at club level. One of the reasons for this is that it can not only be played against
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3 0 1", this, "d2d4"); ' class="line1">1.d4</span> 
, but also against moves such as
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3 0 1", this, "c2c4"); ' class="line1">1.c4</span> 
and
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 1", this, "g1f3"); ' class="line1">1.Nf3</span> 
. These flank openings can cause considerable difficulty for certain Black variations, but not for the King's Indian as Black can just adopt the same set-up as if White had played
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3 0 1", this, "d2d4"); ' class="line1">1.d4</span> 
. In fact, very often White will play d4 later on and we transpose directly back into the King's Indian. For example, here are two alternative move orders:</p>
<p>(1)

and we have transposed into the Fianchetto Variation.</p>
<h3>Objective and layout</h3>
<p>As can be gauged from the title, this is not an opening book aimed at the expert player who has already played the King's Indian for many years (although it may still serve as a useful refresher course in basic King's Indian strategy). Instead it should be of most use to inexperienced players or slightly more experienced players who wish to take up the King's Indian for the first time. Heavy theoretical variations have been kept to a minimum and the emphasis has been placed on explaining the ideas behind the moves in the early stages of the game.</p>
<p>The opening has been covered in a systematic manner and the material split up into ten chapters. By far the most important variation in the King's Indian is the Classical and this is reflected by the fact that it takes up the first four chapters. Each of the other major variations has its own chapter devoted to it while the final chapter covers a number of the lesser played systems. Each chapter is then further split up into several sub-sections and the variations are examined through a short theoretical section followed by illustrative games.</p>
<p>Throughout the book I have drawn attention to the most important King's Indian concepts by way of notes, tips and warnings. There is also a sprinkling of exercises to test you on some of the recurring tactical themes in the King's Indian.</p>
<p>Another feature of the book is that each sub-section has one paragraph entitled 'Theoretical?' and another 'Statistics'. Under 'Theoretical?' we discuss whether it is necessary to burn the midnight oil learning variations or whether it is possible to get by simply on general principles. The statistics section is a useful guide to which side has performed better in each variation. However, statistics can be misleading and I have pointed this out when I think it is the case.</p>
<p>I have done my best to be as objective as possible but there is an inevitable slight bias towards Black. There are a couple of reasons for this. The first is that the majority of players buying this book will be looking to play the King's Indian with Black and the second is that I, myself, have used the opening as my main weapon in over 20 years of international chess. As a consequence I may occasionally be peering at the Black position through rose-tinted spectacles.</p>
<p>The King's Indian is a massive topic and each of the chapters in this book have already had at least one whole book written on them (and even some of the sub-sections have had books written on them!). As you progress in chess you will no doubt feel the need to consult more specialist books but my hope is that this book will start you off on your King's Indian journey full of confidence.</p>
