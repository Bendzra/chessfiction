<p><b>Diagram 1</b>. The Four Pawns Attack</p>
<p>The Four Pawns Attack is the most aggressive way for White to meet the King's Indian. It is a truly dangerous system for the unprepared player to face. By the fifth move White has constructed a massive centre with the simple intention of blowing Black away. He will hope to achieve this by advancing e4-e5 at the right moment. If you had a centre like this a hundred years ago then it was assumed that victory was only a matter of time. Since then chess has moved on and strategies have been devised for combating such centres.</p>
<h3>What are the methods of combating such a centre?</h3>
<p>Black must counter in the centre straightaway. While White has been moving pawns Black has been moving pieces and acquired a small lead in development. Black must try and open the position before White has consolidated. If he succeeds, then the drawbacks to White's risky strategy may become apparent. By moving all his central pawns forward he has weakened a whole group of squares behind the centre. If the centre can be liquidated then Black may well be able to establish advanced outposts on squares such as e3 or d3. But that is a long way in the future and a big 'if'. The Four Pawns Attack is a respectable variation that has evolved over the decades. The centre cannot be destroyed so easily. The point is, though, that if Black doesn't try he is likely to be heading to the showers around move 20.</p>
<p>In the King's Indian Black usually counters in the centre by <b>...e7-e5</b> or <b>...c7-c5</b>. In the Four Pawns Attack Black has traditionally played <b>...c7-c5</b> as it was thought too difficult for him to arrange <b>...e7-e5</b>. While

is still the main line and the subject of our first two sub-sections

followed by <b>...e7-e5</b> has emerged in recent times. This is the subject of our third sub-section.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>1) In the main line of the Four Pawns Attack <b>9...Bg4</b> is Black's most reliable line. <b>9...Re8</b> is also fine but only if you are willing to get involved in a tactical slugfest. <b>9...b5</b> is best left to the historians.</p>
<p>2) White's alternatives to the main line are not without venom. <b>7 dxc5</b>, in particular, is a difficult variation where Black will have to play well to equalize.</p>
<p>3) <b>6...Na6</b> is not a bad choice and these days enjoys almost equal status to <b>6...c5</b>.</p>
