<p><b>Diagram 1</b>. The quiet 5 h3</p>
<h3>Why does White play h3 ?</h3>
<p>The move <b>h2-h3</b> has two main ideas. The first is to support the advance <b>g2-g4</b>. This is played both to gain space on the kingside and to dissuade Black from playing <b>...f7-f5</b>. The second idea is to pave the way for <b>Be3</b> without having to worry about <b>...Ng4</b>. Very often the bishop will go to g5 first but if Black attacks it with <b>...h7-h6</b> then it drops back to e3. The intentions behind h3 are similar to those behind f3 in the Saemisch Variation but the two variations usually lead to quite different types of games. In the favour of <b>h2-h3</b> is the fact that White can still develop the king's knight to its natural home f3 and that the dark squares are not further weakened. On the other hand, <b>h2-h3</b> does nothing to protect the all important e4-square.</p>
<h3>How does Black battle against these h3 systems?</h3>
<p>The first thing Black needs to do is stake his claim in the centre. It is possible to play with <b>...c7-c5</b> but this takes us into the Modern Benoni and outside the scope of this book. Anyway, it is more reliable for Black to play the traditional <b>...e7-e5</b>. Black will usually play for <b>...f7-f5</b> even after White has played <b>g2-g4</b>. The move <b>...Qe8</b> to unpin the knight on f6 is a useful tool if Black doesn't want to let White have it all his own way on the kingside. On other occasions Black will advance on the queenside (<b>...c7-c6</b>, <b>...a7-a5</b>, <b>...a5-a4</b>, <b>...Qa5</b> are all typical moves) while sometimes he tries to play on both sides of the board simultaneously. The basic rule for Black is that he must play actively and with purpose. If he dithers in the opening then he might find that White suddenly has a clamp all over the board and that it is too late for offensive action. Then he will just have to await his fate.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>1) The systems with <b>h2-h3</b> usually lead to a rich full-blooded struggle where Black must play actively to avoid been squashed.</p>
<p>2) The idea of <b>a2-a3</b> and <b>b2-b4</b> is an important stratagem for White to lock the knight on a6 out of the game. Unless Black has made gains in other parts of the board he will be in trouble if this happens.</p>
<p>3) In the lines where Black plays <b>...f7-f5</b> White must keep control of the e4-square. If he fails to do so Black may be able to advance his e-pawn with devastating effect.</p>
<p>4) White scores much better when he plays with <b>Bg5</b> rather than with <b>Be3</b>. In fact, it has become quite unusual for White not to play <b>Bg5</b>.</p>
