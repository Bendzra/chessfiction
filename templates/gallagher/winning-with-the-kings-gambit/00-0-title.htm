<p>“This romantic opening is a real rarity at top-level chess. Probably the greatest expert on this line right now is England's Grandmaster Joe Gallagher."</p>
<p>— Nigel Short in The Daily Telegraph (London)</p>

<p>The King's Gambit has always been a great favorite of tactical players. However, since its heyday in the nineteenth century, it appeared only sporadically in Grandmaster chess. Recently, this has begun to change, and the King's Gambit has once again become a force to be reckoned with. A host of new ideas have appeared, many of them introduced into international competition by the author himself and explained in this book.</p>

<p>•	Unique battle manual for the attacking player</p>
<p>•	Clear presentation from the world's leading modern exponent</p>
<p>•	Completely illustrative games to highlight the important ideas for both sides</p>
<p>•	Coverage of Black's major defences</p>

<p>Grandmaster Joe Gallagher is one of Europe's most attack-minded players. His aggressive style of play is ideally suited to the international Swiss tournament circuit, where he has won numerous events over the last few years. This is his first book for Batsford.</p>
