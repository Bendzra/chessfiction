<p>The King's Gambit is, of course, an opening with a great history, but for the larger part of this century it has been lying dormant, a rare visitor to tournament practice. However, I am inclined to take the optimistic view and regard its demise as purely a matter of fashion.</p>
<p>The Spanish Game (or Ruy Lopez, who incidentally was the first person to publish King's Gambit analysis) has now ruled the open game for countless years, but there is evidence that its reign could be drawing to a close. The last few years have witnessed an upsurge in the popularity of Scotch's, Vienna's and Four Knights', including at the highest level - Kasparov used the Scotch with success in his latest match with Karpov, and Short employed various antiquated systems in his most recent Candidates' tussle with Speelman, even a couple of King's Gambit Declineds by transposition. I believe it can only be a matter of time before the King's Gambit (proper) joins in this revolution. I know that many players have been toying with the idea of introducing the King's Gambit into their repertoire, but have not yet found the courage to push that f-pawn two

squares on their second move. My hope is that this book will help to allay many of their fears.</p>
<p>Winning With the King's Gambit, as the title should inform you, is a look at this opening from the White point of view. Whilst I have endeavoured to remain as objective as possible in my assessments of positions, much more time has been devoted to finding new ideas for White, rather than attempting to refute existing theory where White already stands well. I see this as a task for our future opponents.</p>
<p>The theoretical revival of the King's Gambit is really not that surprising, as it has always been based on sound positional principles. If Black accepts the gambit, then White is normally able to build a strong centre and if Black gives (or loses) the pawn back, White will also achieve a space advantage on the kingside. When Black plays to keep the material with ... g5, then White usually does best to undermine the pawn chain as quickly as possible by playing h4 (see the chapters on Fischer or Kieseritzky, for example), forcing Black to advance ... g4, which can often lead to a wrecked kingside.</p>
<p>The format of this book is one which is becoming increasingly popular and involves studying the opening through a series of annotated games. This is extremely important, as it enables the reader to familiarise himself (or herself) with the middlegame positions (and occasionally endgames) which arise from the King's Gambit.</p>
<p>This is a book for the practical player (but also one who will appreciate the special buzz around this opening), and for that reason not all variations of the King's Gambit are included, but only those which offer White good chances of obtaining the advantage. However, the chosen variations have been analysed in depth, as often it can be just as important to know which variations are bad (and why) as to which are good. The repertoire is based on the King's Knight Gambit, so my apologies to those fans of the Bishop's, and various other third move gambits, but my advice to you is to start playing
