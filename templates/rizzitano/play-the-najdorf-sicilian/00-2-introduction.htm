<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>"Why do you play the Najdorf?" a 12-year-old boy asked me during the spring of 1980 (I was a know-it-all 19-year-old). 'The Najdorf is the only theoretical equalizer - it has the highest ECO code B99 of all king pawn openings and the last line has an evaluation of unclear," I replied with a straight face. Of course, according to this logic I should have been playing the Chigorin Variation of the Ruy Lopez (ECO code C99). The explanation must have been convincing because at a tournament several weeks later the 12-year-old asked: "The thing about the highest ECO code - is that why you play the King's Indian too?" The ruse could not be maintained forever, and for many years every time a Najdorf appeared in one of my games, the future U.S. Champion Patrick Wolff would be quick to remind me that the Najdorf is "the only theoretical equalizer!"</p>
<p>There is at least a grain of truth in most jokes, and it is easy to see why young players across generations are attracted to the Najdorf. After all, you can't go wrong riding on the shoulders of giants and following in the footsteps of many World Champions including Tal, Fischer and Kasparov. The Najdorf is often referred to as the King of Chess Openings - the opening to be played in high-stakes, must-win games at all levels from the local club match to Chess Olympiads and World Championship matches. Let's consider several reasons to play the Najdorf:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black can play for a win with the Najdorf without incurring excessive risk. The pawn-structure is unbalanced and Black has an extra centre pawn.</li>
<li>The Najdorf is considered to be fundamentally sound; this is the gold standard for a chess opening because no one has demonstrated a way for White to obtain an advantage by force.</li>
<li>The world's strongest grandmasters regularly employ the Najdorf and these great players generate a constant supply of fresh, high-level Najdorf games to analyse and learn from.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Najdorf is an opening that can be played for a lifetime - from club player to Grandmaster, the Najdorf has something to offer everyone. I started playing the Najdorf from an initial U.S. Chess Federation rating of 886 to a peak rating of 2585 (a range of almost 1700 points), versus opposition ranging from local club players to a former World Champion. The Najdorf is an excellent weapon for the improving player because its uncompromising nature facilitates the development of several important chess skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Developing or neutralizing an initiative</i>: Will the attack succeed with pieces alone, or do I need to utilize my pawns to clear out the defender's pieces? Do I have enough pieces around my opponent's king to sustain the initiative, or will the attack peter out and leave me vulnerable to a strong counterattack? This is a skill that tends to improve with experience.</li>
<li><i>Evaluating king safety</i>: Both White and Black must constantly evaluate the vulnerability of their respective kings. In some lines, Black's king is most comfortable in the centre because there it is shielded by Black's two centre pawns. The Poisoned Pawn Variation features several lines where Black's king appears to be boxed in, but it defies the attacking army by slipping away along the dark squares weakened by the exchange of White's dark-squared bishop.</li>
<li><i>Handling dynamic pawn-structures</i>: White often develops an initiative by launching the g4 pawn advance, while Black must decide whether to ignore the pawn, restrain the pawn with <b>...h6</b>, or counterattack in the centre with a timely <b>...e5</b> or <b>...d5</b>. Similar decisions must be made on the queenside: should White play a4 to restrict Black from playing <b>...b5</b>? The Classical Najdorf features several lines where Black restrains from playing
<!--p>introduction</p--><!--p>7</p-->
...b5 because the reply a4 weakens Black's queenside; this tends to be more of a concern for Black after White has castled kingside.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Najdorf starts with these moves:

Najdorf, given the prominence of the Poisoned Pawn in particular. However, it is in many respects the backbone of the Najdorf, as can be seen from the fact that play generally continues

<p>Note that Black has played both <b>...Nbd7</b> and <b>...Qc7</b>, the characteristic moves of the Gelfand and Kasparov Variations, and both those variations are indeed attempts to improve upon the Main Line. If White avoids the critical lines in the Poisoned Pawn or Polugaevsky, positions of a similar type can also arise. Thus the themes underpinning the Main Line are of great importance even to players who prefer different lines. Many of the key Sicilian concepts are found in abundance in its theory: the <b>Nd5</b> sacrifice, White's kingside pawn-storm, Black's counterplay with <b>...h6</b> and <b>...g5</b>, Black's flexibility with respect to his king's location - these and a host of other Sicilian ideas find their clearest expression in the Main Line.</p>
