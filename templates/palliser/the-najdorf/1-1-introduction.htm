, but this move usually heralds a positional, manoeuvring approach. His aim is often to gain control of d5 and that square must always be at the forefront of Black's mind. In general Black wishes to force White to recapture after any exchange of knights on d5 with his e-pawn. Then d5 is no longer a weakness and Black will mobilize his newly created kingside majority with <b>...f5</b>, while aiming to hold up White on the queenside. Initially players like Geller scored well by exploiting the extra queenside pawn, but Black has grown wise to the situation as we will see in this chapter. There are a few exceptions in which Black can play around a knight on d5, but in general allowing White an unopposed knight on d5 must be avoided. The game <b>J.Polgar-V.Anand, Wijk aan Zee 1998</b> should serve as a reminder of what to avoid:</p>

<p class="caption"><b><i>The d5-knight dominates</i></b></p>
<p>With so few pieces left Black lacked any counterplay, while the knight completely dominated the bishop. Polgar maintained control and went on to score a crushing victory.</p>
<p class="warning message">WARNING: Always beware the move <b>Bg5</b>, angling to exchange on f6. After that exchange Black still needs to be covering d5 and so ideally wants to recapture on f6 with his remaining knight. Placing the light-squared bishop on e6 or b7 also importantly contributes to the struggle for the key d5-square.</p>

</p>
<p>By far the most popular retreat, although this knight will take some time to find a good role. From b3 it does, however, support White's queenside play, and especially the advance of White's a and c-pawns, while White also hopes to deter any ideas of <b>...Nd7-c5</b>, undermining the e4-pawn. The two alternatives promise Black an easy game, although one remains a tricky surprise weapon:</p>

, preventing <b>Bg5</b> and also enabling the c8-bishop to be developed to e6, without being hassled by <b>Ng5</b>.
White's play is reminiscent of the Boleslavsky system (

Here the knight can proceed straight to d7 and
