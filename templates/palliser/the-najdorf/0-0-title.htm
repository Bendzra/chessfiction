<h2>About this publication</h2>
<h3>Starting Out: Sicilian Najdorf</h3>
<p>The Sicilian Najdorf is one of Black's sharpest and most popular lines against 1 e4. From the very start Black directs the game into asymmetrical positions in which he or she can play for the win without unjustified risk. For this reason the Najdorf has been a firm favourite amongst the very elite of world chess, including Garry Kasparov and, before him, Bobby Fischer. What attracts such world-class players to the Najdorf is the fact that it is tremendously dynamic and yet both sound and respectable at the same time. Despite numerous attempts, no one has found a sure-fire way for White to gain the advantage.</p>
<p>In Starting Out: Sicilian Najdorf Richard Palliser takes a fresh look at this famous opening. The early moves and ideas are introduced and care is taken to explain the reasoning behind them - something that is often neglected or taken for granted. As with previous works in the popular Everyman Chess Starting Out series, the reader is helped throughout with a plethora of notes, tips and warnings highlighting the vital characteristics of the Sicilian Najdorf and of opening play in general.</p>
<br />
<p>*Written by a Sicilian Najdorf expert</p>
<p>*All the main lines are covered</p>
<p>*Ideal for the improving player</p>
<br />
<p>Richard Palliser is a young English International Master who is quickly carving out a reputation as a skilled and prolific chess writer. His previous works for Everyman Chess include The Bb5 Sicilian and Tango!, both of which were warmly received by the critics and chess public alike.</p>
