<h3>Points to Remember</h3>
<p>1) Gallagher's favourite <b>...Nc5</b> idea has ensured that former adherents of the Karpov system have turned their attention elsewhere in a bid for a positional edge.</p>
<p>2) Black should also try to follow up an exchange of knights on d5 with <b>...Nc5</b>. White can then gain a passed d-pawn, but must face a mobile black kingside majority.</p>
<p>3) With no other minor pieces left, an unopposed knight on d5 against a black dark-squared bishop usually spells trouble. Black should always try to ensure that White must recapture on d5 with a pawn, but if White does win d5 for a piece, such as in the <b>8.Bg5</b> lines, Black must seek active counterplay on the flanks.</p>
<p>4) Meeting <b>9.a4 Be6 10.f4</b> with <b>10...exf4</b> should ensure Black of an easy game so long as he remembers to activate his e7-bishop with ...Ne8.</p>
<p>5) The popular <b>9.Kh1</b> should be treated with respect, but the equally crafty <b>9...b6</b> gives Black a perfectly acceptable position.</p>
