<h3>Points to Remember</h3>
<p>1) <b>7 Nf3</b> should not be underestimated. It leads to a tough positional battle and Black must make sure not to allow any early mishaps on the d5 and e6 squares.</p>
<p>2) The English Attack is a fashionable and dangerous weapon which Black must be prepared for. There is a fair amount of theory, but there are also general strategies and principles to help both sides through the more theoretical lines.</p>
<p>3) Black's play after either an early <b>...h5</b> or in the <b>...Be6</b> and <b>...Nbd7</b> lines is fairly thematic, and these are generally easier to play than the <b>...Be7</b> positions.</p>
<p>4) The main line of <b>...Be7</b> with <b>10...Nbd7</b> is popular amongst grandmasters, but is rather complex. At lower levels Black, if determined to gain a queenside attack, should still be successful with <b>10...a5!?</b> and <b>10...b5!?</b>, and neither is yet fully refuted from a theoretical perspective.</p>
