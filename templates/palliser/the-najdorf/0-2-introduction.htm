<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>A Fine Pedigree</h3>
<p>'So what opening will you be facing?' asked the seasoned club player. His friend, with some trepidation, replied in a hushed tone: 'he plays the Najdorf! If only I also could...'</p>
<p>The Najdorf is an opening which possesses a certain aura; not surprisingly considering its position as a mainstay in the defences of both Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov. It is also extremely popular, being used in no fewer than 13 of the 56 games at the recent World Championship in San Luis. That is a large percentage, but what is so special about this variation which begins

<p class="caption"><b><i>The Sicilian Najdorf</i></b></p>
<p>Against
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1", this, "e2e4"); ' class="line1">1.e4</span> 
, Black can easily face a dilemma as to whether to opt for a counterattacking but risky opening or to prefer a solid start to the game. The problem with the likes of the Caro is that Black will often find it hard to win the game should White be happy with a sterile draw. What we really want is an opening which is dynamic yet sound, but also offers good opportunities to quickly seize the initiative or to develop a strong attack. The Najdorf fulfils those criteria and comes with the important bonus that there is no effective way for White to kill the game off after
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6", this, "a7a6"); ' class="line1">5...a6</span> 
. One couldn't want more from an opening, and it is no wonder that so many of the world's elite consider it one of Black's very best defences to
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1", this, "e2e4"); ' class="line1">1.e4</span> 
, if not even the best.</p>
<p>Returning to our club players, we might wonder why more don't play the Najdorf considering the respect they have for their colleagues who actually do. Usually the response is that as the opening is played by so many grandmasters, it must be incredibly hard and time-consuming for the club player to learn. However, the final advantage of playing this great opening is that much of Black's play is very thematic. Black will need to know some theory, especially against White's sharpest options of
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6", this, "c1g5"); ' class="line1">6.Bg5</span>

, but even there a number of common motifs frequently occur. The aim of this Starting Out guide is simple: to enable club players to quickly master the basics of the Najdorf, although it may also be of use as a refresher guide to those with some actual experience of the opening.</p>
<h3>The Mysterious 5...a6</h3>
<p>The Najdorf has been played by a vast array of famous players, but to the uninitiated Black's fifth move may appear a little baffling. After

is a crafty move with which Black usefully keeps his options open over how to employ his e-pawn.
He would like to gain a foothold in the centre, but after
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq e6 0 6", this, "e7e5"); ' class="line1">5...e5</span>

allows a trade of light-squared bishops which weakens Black's control over the d5-square.
As we will quickly come to appreciate in Chapter One, the d5-square is all-important and it was that which White players in the fifties initially spent much of their time trying to exploit after

. Finally, <b>...a6</b> also fits into Black's development scheme as a quick ...b5 often allows him to cause early problems by undermining the c3-knight.</p>
<h3>History and Popularity</h3>
<p>The position arising after
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6", this, "a7a6"); ' class="line1">5...a6</span> 
was reached before the war by no lesser players than Saviely Tartakower and Viacheslav Ragozin. However, it wasn't until the end of that terrible conflict that the Czech Karel Opocensky began to successfully counter
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6", this, "f1e2"); ' class="line1">6.Be2</span> 
with
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq e6 0 7", this, "e7e5"); ' class="line1">6...e5!</span> 
. Miguel Najdorf, by then resident in Argentina, was quick to spot the strength of Opocensky's discovery and he began to regularly uphold the variation against the top players in the world. Thus the variation became known as the Najdorf, even though Najdorf himself wasn't its inventor.</p>
<p>By the fifties Mikhail Tal was joining Najdorf in making an important contribution to the theory and success of the variation before it became an important part of Tigran Petrosian's armoury. That the opening could suit the young Tal, with his love of complications and the attack, and also Petrosian, with his preference for strategical play, reminds us of the wide merits of the Najdorf. Its mantle was famously next taken over by Bobby Fischer whose many successes with the opening bolstered its popularity. However, the arrival of the positional maestro Anatoly Karpov at the head of the chess world led to White making some inroads against
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6", this, "f1e2"); ' class="line1">6.Be2</span>

. Thus Black, and especially Garry Kasparov, began to meet
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6", this, "f1e2"); ' class="line1">6.Be2</span>

, taking play into a Scheveningen variation, but by the end of the eighties Black had managed to prove that he was far from being positionally strangled after
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6", this, "f1e2"); ' class="line1">6.Be2</span>

.</p>
<p>Today the majority of the best players in the world regularly employ

. Some of those do though still prefer the very theoretical and complex Scheveningen against

remains a popular choice at lower levels where players change their opening choices far less often. Thus we will initially examine the nuances of

;
by far the most popular move of the past fifteen years against the Najdorf. After that we will come to appreciate the dynamic benefits of the black set-up with <b>6...e6</b> in response to
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6", this, "f1c4"); ' class="line1">6.Bc4</span> 
before seeing Black also maintain pawn control over d5 against

. That may have lost its place as the main line, but it remains pretty critical and very theoretical. Finally we cover those rare sixth moves with which the opponent may hope to trick you on to unknown territory, but Black can generally and successfully meet the likes of

<p>Whole books have been written on both

and so comprehensive coverage clearly wasn't possible here. However, I have aimed to pick out the most critical lines and to supply sufficient theoretical coverage and general understanding for one to initially meet those variations with confidence. Overall, heavy theoretical variations have been kept to a minimum; the aim is to explain the key ideas which underlie the theory. However, as you progress in chess there will come a day when more specialist works will need to be consulted, but this work should suffice for the inexperienced player or the more experienced player new to the Najdorf. Throughout I have tried to be as objective as possible, although a bias towards Black was inevitable in places. After all, this book is chiefly designed for those seeking to take up the Najdorf, although those looking for a new variation against it may also find something here.</p> <p>As this is a Starting Out guide the key points are highlighted with a liberal sprinkling of tips, ideas and warnings. There are also sections entitled 'Theoretical?' where we discuss how theoretical a variation is. Thus, for example, we will learn that the famous Poisoned Pawn variation (

) requires a lot of memorization, whereas elsewhere Black can get by much more with good general understanding. 'Statistics' is another important section where we will see how well the variation in question has been performing. Of course statistics can be misleading at times, and I've tried to point out those occasions, while they are drawn from ChessBase's Big Database 2005; a collection of almost three million games. The good news is that overall on the database Black averages 46%, but with the Najdorf his score improves to an impressive 49%.</p>
