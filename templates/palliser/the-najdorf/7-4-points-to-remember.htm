<h3>Points to Remember</h3>
<p>1) Always respect the opponent's choice of variation and try to understand their aims. All the lines in this chapter have caught out several unprepared players over the years.</p>
<p>2) <b>6...e5</b> and <b>12...Bg4!-h5-g6</b> is an excellent way to neutralize White's attacking ideals after <b>6.f4</b>.</p>
<p>3) Developing the queenside first gives Black useful extra flexibility against <b>6.g3</b>.</p>
<p>4) Against the likes of <b>6.a4</b>, but especially <b>6.h3</b>, Black should remember that he may prefer something other than <b>6...e5</b>.</p>
