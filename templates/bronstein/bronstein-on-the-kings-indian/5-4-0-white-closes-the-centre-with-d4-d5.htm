<h3>White closes the centre with d4-d5</h3>
<p>With <b>d4-d5</b> White cramps his opponent, but also restricts his own possibilities: for example, his knight can no longer go to d5. With this pawn advance he fixes the d6 pawn and after suitable preparation he is ready to attack it by <b>c4-c5</b>. Black has a choice:</p>
<p>(a) Leaving his c7 pawn on its initial square, he can reply with an immediate counterattack: <b>...Nf6-h5</b> (<b>...Nf6-d7</b>, <b>...Nf6-e8</b>) and <b>...f7-f5-f4</b>, or first play <b>...a7-a5</b>, for the moment preventing <b>b2-b4</b>.</p>
<p>(b) He can play <b>...c7-c6</b> and then exchange pawns with <b>...c6xd5</b> at a moment when it is unfavourable for White to recapture with his knight (e.g. because the e4 pawn is lost), or with his e4 pawn (because of the possible attack <b>...f7-f5</b> and <b>...e5-e4</b>). After <b>c4xd5</b> the threat of the <b>c4-c5</b> attack has been eliminated. On the other hand, Black now has other problems: the c-file has been opened and White may double rooks with the aim of invading at c7.</p>
<p>(c) He can physically prevent the advance of the white c-pawn by playing <b>...c7-c5</b>, before proceeding with his counterattack on the kingside.</p>
