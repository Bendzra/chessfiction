<h2>2. The basic functions of the two armies</h2>
<p>Before we move on to a description of the 120 standard moves, we consider it worthwhile explaining the basic roles of the members of the black and white armies.</p>
<p>In very general terms, as the reader may already know, rooks should aim for open lines, bishops for open diagonals, and knights for strong points. The queen likes space (which is why normally it is best not brought out too early in the game, when the board is crowded), pawns like to advance together, opening lines for the pieces, and the king seeks a shelter, from where it can command the battle from the rear.</p>
<p>In the King's Indian Defence these general aims take the following more concrete form:</p>
<h3>Functions of the black pieces</h3>
<b>Ra8</b>
<p>• To wait at its post and support the advance of the a-pawn.</p>
<p>• To move to b8 to support the advance of the b-pawn.</p>
<p>• To move to d8 or e8 to be ready for action in the centre.</p>
<b>Nb8</b>
<p>• To move to d7 (or c6) to support the e5 pawn.</p>
<p>• To manoeuvre via b8-d7-c5 (or b8-a6-c5) to the c5 square, if there is no longer a white pawn at d4.</p>
<b>Bc8</b>
<p>• To wait at its post, controlling the c8-h3 diagonal.</p>
<b>Qd8</b>
<p>• To wait at its post until the pawn formation is determined.</p>
<p>• Then to move out on the d8-a5 diagonal, or onto the e-file.</p>
<b>Ke8</b>
<p>• To castle (as soon as the king's bishop and king's knight clear the way), helping the king's rook to move closer to the centre, and vacating the e8 square for possible manoeuvres of the queen, rook and knight.</p>
