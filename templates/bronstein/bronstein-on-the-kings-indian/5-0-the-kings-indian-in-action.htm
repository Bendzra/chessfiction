<h2>5. The King's Indian in action</h2>
<p>Presented here are fifty King's Indian games played by David Bronstein, played over a time-span of more than half a century. Many of these games, as well as those in the following chapter of 64 additional games, are fairly old. However, this is by no means a bad thing: such games demonstrate the basic ideas more clearly, whereas present-day grandmasters are well familiar with the plans available, and so their games turn out to be much more complex. Therefore for beginners it is better to study old games, even if to modern experts they may seem somewhat primitive.</p>
<p>To facilitate the assimilation of the material, we have divided up the games into seven sections, depending on the central pawn formation and on the relative placing of the kings:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="5-1-restrained-set-up-by-white.htm">Restrained set-up by White</a></li>
<li><a href="5-2-white-exchanges-d4xe5.htm">White exchanges d4xe5</a></li>
<li><a href="5-3-black-captures-_e5xd4.htm">Black captures ... e5xd4</a></li>
<li><a href="5-4-0-white-closes-the-centre-with-d4-d5.htm">White closes the centre with d4-d5</a></li>
<ul>
<li><a href="5-4-1-black-keeps-his-pawn-at-c7.htm">Black keeps his pawn at c7</a></li>
<li><a href="5-4-2-black-opens-the-c-file.htm">Black opens the c-file</a></li>
<li><a href="5-4-3-black-pawns-at-e5-and-c5.htm">Black pawns at e5 and c5</a></li>
</ul>
<li><a href="5-5-the-central-tension-is-maintained.htm">The central tension is maintained</a></li>
<li><a href="5-6-benoni-set-ups.htm">Benoni set-ups</a></li>
<li><a href="5-7-white-castles-queenside.htm">White castles queenside</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A familiarity with the standard King's Indian moves, and the ideas behind them, which were explained in Chapter 3, will make it easier for the reader to follow these games. Basically every game (at least in the opening stage) is made up of the standard moves, performed in various orders. The difficulty in playing the King's Indian, or indeed any other opening, is the fact that you have an opponent with his own ideas, which you are trying to counter.</p>
