<h1>BRONSTEIN<br>on the King's Indian</h1>
<p>This book demonstrates that the King's Indian is not a difficult opening to play or master, showing that it leads to rich and interesting positions in which both sides can enjoy a complicated struggle. The emphasis is on understanding the typical moves and manoeuvres and the overall 'spirit' of the defence, not on memorizing reams of theory.</p>
<p>The book also contains fifty of Russian grandmaster David Bronstein's favourite games that he has played with the King's Indian, not all with Black, and not all ending in wins, but games that demonstrate the wide variety of ideas and positions that can arise in this exciting defence.</p>
<p>David Bronstein was one of the two creators of the King's Indian Defence and is also the co-author of the highly acclaimed The Sorcerer's Apprentice.</p>
