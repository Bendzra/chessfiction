<h2>Postscript</h2>
<p>On the occasion of David Bronstein's 75th birthday in February 1999, Garry Kasparov published a tribute on his web site in which he described him as 'the most enigmatic figure in the chess world', and mentioned that in the 1970s and even the 1980s he used to follow with interest Bronstein's games, in each of which some new and surprising idea could be found. This striving for originality, as opposed to mere competitive results, has been David's distinguishing feature throughout his career, yet despite this he has an enviable record of success, for details of which the reader is referred to The Sorcerer's Apprentice by David Bronstein and Tom Fuerstenberg (Cadogan 1995).</p>
