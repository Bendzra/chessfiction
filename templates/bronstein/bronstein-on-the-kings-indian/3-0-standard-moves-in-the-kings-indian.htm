<h2>3. Standard moves in the King's Indian</h2>
<p>In this chapter we have first selected the thirty-six moves of the black pieces that occur most often in the opening stage of the King's Indian Defence. It is useful to know the essential point of each of these moves. This is much easier than trying to learn by heart thousands of complicated variations, and besides, all these variations will inevitably include a selection of our '36 moves', only each time in a different order.</p>
<p>We then give the twenty-four most frequently occurring moves of the black pawns, making a total of 60 moves. The point behind a particular move is usually the same whatever the actual position on the board, although, of course, exceptions occur. Therefore careful consideration must be given to the other side's moves, and logical decisions taken. If in addition to this you try to remember the 60 standard moves of the white pawns and pieces, you will have information of in total the 120 most frequently-occurring moves in the King's Indian Defence.</p>
<p>In the following sections we have given examples of many of these standard moves, taken from the annotated games in Chapter 5 (Games 1-50), or from the additional games in Chapter 6 (Games A1-A64).</p>
