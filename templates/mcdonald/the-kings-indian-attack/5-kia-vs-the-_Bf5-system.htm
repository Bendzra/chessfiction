<p>Black might decide to counter

by building a 'Slav' triangle of pawns on c6, d5, and e6. This is a very solid centre structure, but it has the drawback that the bishop on c8 finds all roads to activity blocked. Therefore it makes sense to get the bishop out before playing <b>...e7-e6</b>. This can be done with a quick <b>...Bg4</b>, which is the subject of Chapter Six, or <b>...Bf5</b> which we'll discuss here.</p>
<p>A typical opening sequence is:</p>

<p>To keep play in the style of the King's Indian Attack, White will engineer an <b>e2-e4</b> pawn advance beginning with <b>d2-d3</b> and <b>Nbd2</b>; if he prefers the <b>c2-c4</b> pawn advance we are in the territory of the Réti Opening.</p>

<p>White has developed his queen's bishop to an open diagonal on b2 and with the help of his queen achieved his aim of advancing <b>e2-e4</b>. For his part, Black has secured a safe spot for his bishop on h7 and has kicked off his queenside activity with
 <span onclick='loadMove("rn1q1rk1/1p2bpp1/2p1pn1p/p2p1b2/8/1P1P1NP1/PBPNPPBP/R3QRK1 w - a6 0 10", this, "a7a5"); ' class="line1">9...a5</span> 
. The middlegame is about to begin, with both players manoeuvring for advantage. This is the way Game 23 below started.</p>
<h3>What are the advantages to Black's set-up?</h3>
<p>As we can see in the sequence above, Black gets to develop his pieces quickly to good centre squares without being saddled with weaknesses in his pawn structure. He can also be fairly sure that his king won't come under a big attack in the early stages of the game. Indeed, White has to devote his energy to arranging <b>e2-e4</b>, not to looking for the initiative. On the kingside Black normally remains passive behind his solid defensive perimeter. More positively, he can seek counterplay by utilizing his queenside pawns. A good way to start is with
 <span onclick='loadMove("rn1q1rk1/1p2bpp1/2p1pn1p/p2p1b2/8/1P1P1NP1/PBPNPPBP/R3QRK1 w - a6 0 10", this, "a7a5"); ' class="line1">9...a5</span> 
, as in the diagram above. Alternatively, Black might play in the centre with <b>...d5xe4</b> and, after White's recapture d3xe4, try to exploit the open d-file and put pressure on the e4-pawn. However, this idea is mostly specific to a situation where White plays a quick <b>Ne5</b>, as in Game 24.</p>
<h3>What are the disadvantages to Black's set-up?</h3>
<p>Black hardly ever manages to equalize the space balance on the kingside with <b>...e6-e5</b>. Therefore White can hope in the future to engineer an <b>f2-f4</b> advance, followed in some cases by <b>f4-f5</b>. This would besiege the e6-pawn and lead to the opening of the f-file as the preliminary to an attack on the black king. Sometimes the alternative advance <b>e4-e5</b> can be strong, but this is somewhat problematical as it shuts in a bishop posted on b2 and gives the enemy bishop on h7 more daylight. We might say that the <b>e4-e5</b> advance is either very strong or very weak.</p>
<p>An important part of White's strategy depends on patience. He has to manoeuvre his pieces and keep them in good shape whilst waiting for the chances that appear when Black, in search of the initiative, loosens his position. In this respect the King's Indian Attack is like a martial art: White often tries to use the opponent's strength or momentum against him. Thus he will let Black advance on the queenside in the hope that he will over extend himself, so that his advancing pawns run out of energy and become hard to defend.</p>
<p>Opportunities for White might also arise in the centre as Black's plan unfolds. For example, the pawn on d5 looks like an immovable barrier to the bishop on g2 as it is guarded by henchmen on c6 and e6. But in the natural course of Black's queenside action he could well play <b>...c6-c5</b> to utilize the pawn as a battering ram (he may also want to free the c6-square for his knight). In that case the d5-pawn suddenly becomes a legitimate target.</p>
<p>Or imagine if Black exchanges with <b>...d5xe4</b> in order to be the first to get his rooks to the open d-file. If White has coordinated his pieces well he can gradually wrest control of it - Black's own plan is used against him.</p>
<h3>What sequence of moves should I choose as White?</h3>
<p>The order of moves isn't so critical when the two armies don't begin their hand to hand fighting until the early middlegame. You could even begin with
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1", this, "b2b3"); ' class="line1">1.b3</span> 
and eventually reach a standard KIA versus Slav position if that's what Black wishes. Of course, he could well answer
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1", this, "b2b3"); ' class="line1">1.b3</span> 
with
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6 0 2", this, "e7e5"); ' class="line1">1...e5</span> 
or
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6 0 2", this, "c7c5"); ' class="line1">1...c5</span> 
or some other set-up.
The move
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1", this, "g2g3"); ' class="line1">1.g3</span> 
encounters the same repertoire problem: we are fine against
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6 0 2", this, "d7d5"); ' class="line1">1...d5</span> 
or
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6 0 2", this, "c7c5"); ' class="line1">1...c5</span> 
, but what to do if
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6 0 2", this, "e7e5"); ' class="line1">1...e5</span> 
, stopping the KIA? There are many decent ideas, of course, not least
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3 0 2", this, "c2c4"); ' class="line1">2.c4</span> 
transposing to the English Opening, but it takes us out of the scope of this book.</p>
<p>The good thing about beginning
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 1", this, "g1f3"); ' class="line1">1.Nf3</span> 
is that it cuts down Black's options - you've stopped
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq e6 0 2", this, "e7e5"); ' class="line1">1...e5</span> 
and if
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq c6 0 2", this, "c7c5"); ' class="line1">1...c5</span> 
you could play
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq e3 0 2", this, "e2e4"); ' class="line1">2.e4</span> 
and then transpose to a KIA versus the Sicilian with
 <!--span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3", this, "e2e4"); ' class="line1">2...z0</span--> 
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3", this, "d2d3"); ' class="line1">3.d3</span> 
, etc. Alternatively, you could answer
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq c6 0 2", this, "c7c5"); ' class="line1">1...c5</span> 
with
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2", this, "g2g3"); ' class="line1">2.g3</span> 
 <!--span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3", this, "g2g3"); ' class="line1">z0</span--> 
and
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 3", this, "f1g2"); ' class="line1">3.Bg2</span> 
, and leave it to Black to play a Reversed King's Indian or some other structure. In any case you're keeping play within the bounds of the repertoire in this book.</p>
<p>So that's why
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 1", this, "g1f3"); ' class="line1">1.Nf3</span> 
is the move of choice in this part of the book, rather than
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1", this, "b2b3"); ' class="line1">1.b3</span> 
or
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1", this, "g2g3"); ' class="line1">1.g3</span> 
. Having said all this, the first game I wish to show you in this chapter does feature an early b2-b3 by White. It's too good to miss out on.</p>
<h3>Do you love your knight more than your bishop?</h3>
<p>Still thinking of move order, a key question for White in the KIA with <b>...Bf5</b> is: 'How quickly do I wish to commit myself to <b>b2-b3</b> and <b>Bb2</b>, if at all?'. It's worth remembering that as soon as you play <b>b2-b3</b>, you're closing down your options somewhat.</p>
<p>The alternative is to do something fast with the knight on f3. In Game 24 the horse jumps forwards to e5 to clear the way for <b>f2-f4</b>, in Game 25 it goes to h4 to harass the black bishop on f5, and in Game 26 it powers backwards with <b>Nfd2</b> to support the advance <b>e2-e4</b>. I'll leave it up to you to decide how you wish to play after 'seeing the evidence' in this chapter.</p>
<h3>A model game</h3>
<p>Overcoming a problem in your opening repertoire can have a massive effect on your results, and not just because you do better in the line that you have improved. It lifts your overall mood and makes you play better in general when you're not haunted by the fear 'What if my opponent plays the problem line against me?'. It's even better when the variation you always lose against becomes the line you always win against.</p>
<p>I'd like to show you how a simple change in my opening repertoire boosted my results and helped me get the IM title. Up until 1985 with White I always used to enter into the New York System versus the Réti with moves such as:</p>
<p>

<p>I wouldn't have the faintest idea what to do. My musings (or rather 'thoughts leading to mental paralysis') were something like: 'If White advances in the centre then the bishop on h7 comes to life. But if I do nothing Black can gain ground on the queenside by preparing <b>...b7-b5</b>, or in some cases by arranging an advance in the centre himself with <b>...e5-e4</b>. I already stand badly.' Whether this assessment of the position was objectively true or not is irrelevant - what mattered is that as a young player inexperienced in solving strategic problems I was completely at sea, and suffered some horrible loses as White.</p>
<p>I was perplexed for a long time, but then I came across the game <b>Nimzowitsch-Rubinstein</b> in Ray Keene's book <i>Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack</i>. Yes, here at last was the solution. If White didn't play
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3 0 2", this, "c2c4"); ' class="line2">2.c4</span> 
, the bishop on h7 could be shut out of the game because the d3-pawn would act like solid granite (I got that expression from Nimzowitsch via Keene as well). That means the e-pawn can advance without loosening the centre too much.</p>
<p>It didn't take much to tweak my opening repertoire, and I won my next six games against Black's set-up. I went from holding my breath out of fear that my opponent would play this set-up to holding my breath out of fear that he wouldn't 'fall into the trap'. It makes you wonder how many players continue to persevere with an opening that they always fail against, putting it down to bad luck when their opponent plays the line they fear, rather than making the mental effort to learn an opening that they actually understand.</p>
<p>Here then is the Nimzowitsch game. I'm not recommending that you play his move order, but the general plan is easy to understand and the use of the white kingside pawns highly instructive.</p>

<p>It's very important for White to do something about the black a-pawn. After the routine

with the initiative on the queenside. He wouldn't have to do anything at once with the pawn, he could just leave ideas of <b>...a4-a3</b> or <b>...a4xb3</b> hanging over White's head. This would be a permanent distraction for White from his plan of advancing on the kingside: for example, if he played Rae1 at any point then <b>...a4xb3</b> would clear the way for an invasion of the seventh rank by the black rook with <b>...Ra2</b>.</p>
<p>You can't play the King's Indian Attack to a high level unless you play preventive, or prophylactic, moves like

.</p>
<p>However, option 'b', moving the a-pawn one square, is also worthy of attention. If Black's knight were still on b8, rather than developed to d7,

as it would stop the knight being developed to a strong post on the queenside with <b>...Na6</b> and <b>...Nb4</b>. Incidentally, this justifies our doubt about the move

– the knight didn't need to be developed straightaway and might have done better lingering for a while on b8.

<p class="notification message">ANSWER: We know we are playing the King's Indian Attack, but Black can't be too sure. If, for example,

, switching to an English. Then White is not only attacking d5, but also clearing the way for a quick <b>Qb3</b> to exploit the bishop's absence from c8 to attack the b7-pawn. Therefore Black normally plays
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4", this, "c7c6"); ' class="line1">3...c6</span>

) to strengthen the d5-pawn before committing his bishop to f5. If White then switches to an English set-up with <b>c2-c4</b> and <b>Qb3</b>, he can always defend b7 with a move like <b>...Qb6</b> or <b>...Qc7</b>. Besides, after <b>...c7-c6</b> Black can also consider answering <b>c2-c4</b> with <b>...d5xc4</b>.</p>

</p>
<p>White has developed his kingside and castled in the minimum number of moves. On the other hand, he hasn't put any immediate pressure on the d5-pawn. This means that Black can develop his light-squared bishop to an active square outside his pawn chain. In other queen pawn openings, such as the main line Slav and Queen's Gambit, the bishop is often consigned to remain on c8 shut in by an <b>...e7-e6</b> move. So you can understand the attraction of <b>...Bf5</b> here for Black and, indeed, <b>...Bg4</b> in Chapter Six.</p>

as premature at best – or perhaps I should be less kind and call it a serious mistake:</p>
<p>(1) It shuts in White's bishop on b2.</p>
<p>(2) It takes the e5-square away from the knight (<b>Ne5</b> is often a useful preliminary to gaining space with <b>f2-f4</b>).</p>
<p>(3) It takes away flexibility from the white centre, as the e4-pawn no longer supports a future <b>f4-f5</b> advance.</p>
<p>(4) It makes Black's bishop on h7 a better piece because it can now see the d3-pawn, which it can help to target in combination with a future <b>...Nb4</b> deployment and a possible <b>...c5-c4</b> pawn advance.</p>
<p>Here is an exaggerated example of White removing all the barriers ro Black's light-squared bishop through adherung to the motto 'seizing space is always right':</p>

<p>White gains two tempi with these pawn advances, but so what? Time might be of vital importance in the Sicilian and other open games, but here with the centre blocked the harmony of pieces and pawns is paramount. White's dark-squared bishop is reduced to being a 'big pawn' whilst the defences along the b1-h7 diagonal have been systematically removed.</p>

<p>It is vital that you look at the specific position in front of you – the interaction of the pieces and pawns – before committing yourself to <b>e4-e5</b>.

is highly awkward for the white queen. She has no safe moves and is pinned against her knight. This shows that you can't always judge a move on general principles. At first glance it looks right to maintain a pawn on e4, keeping the bishop on h7 shut out of the game, and denying the black knights access to the d5- and f5-squares. However, the embarrassment caused to the white queen along the d-file is of much greater significance.</p>
<p>A general principle does govern the position after all, but it says: 'Don't open a file if your opponent can exploit it.' As always in chess strategy, it is finding the general principle that is 'top dog' in a specific situation that is the difficulty.</p>

<p>This is the 'cleanest' way for White to play as it avoids any weaknesses in his pawn structure. Black won't be able to gain any initiative on the queenside. On the contrary, there is a hint of light-square fragility on b5 and c4.

, as it is a little passive. Besides exchanging off the knight on e5 doesn't necessarily favour Black – it is after all blocking the advance of White's e4-pawn. Instead Lopez Martinez has a more ambitious plan: to put strong pressure on the e4-pawn in order to paralyze White's build-up. With this in mind, he puts his queen on d4 and queen's knight on c5, so that, including the other knight on f6 and bishop on h7, he now has four units attacking the key e4 point.</p>
<p>As well as this, the queen on d4 and the rook on d8 exert pressure down the d-file. White can't move the knight from d2 without e4 dropping, which means that for the moment he can't develop his bishop from c1 nor his rook from a1. Thus we see a drawback to

he would have developed his queenside, and we couldn't call the d4-square weak if White's knight had remained on f3 guarding it.</p>
<p>Over the last few moves White has anticipated Black's plan. He has made sure he can defend the pawn on e4 with both queen and rook (<b>Qe2</b>, <b>Re1</b>), and evacuated his king from g1 before Black's queen landed on d4 (<b>Kh1</b>).</p>

<p class="warning message">EXERCISE: Imagine that Black decides his pieces are on their optimum squares and so waits, say, with

, and then plays passive moves like <b>...Rfe8</b>, <b>...Bf8</b>, and then in the absence of direct threats by White keeps moving the bishop backwards and forwards with <b>...Be7</b> and <b>...Bf8</b>, etc. How would you slowly build up White's game?</p>
<p class="notification message">ANSWER: It's often the case that when a player has adopted a strategy that doesn't involve the use of pawns things come to a standstill, because all his big pieces are on good squares, but there is no way to breakthrough to hurt the opponent. In this specific case Black needs some cannon fodder to rush at the enemy and open lines, but all the black pieces involved in the attack on e4 and along the d-file are too expensive to sacrifice.</p>
<p>In contrast, White's position still has scope for improvement. His pawns on the queenside can add strength to his game, and we shouldn't forget the pawn ram <b>g4-g5</b> is available on the kingside.</p>
<p>Let's imagine

<p>When a strong player makes a mistake it is often for psychological reasons. Here Black loses his sense of danger and goes hunting the a4-pawn at the cost of his king's safety. Might we talk of a loss of patience, fear of a white attack on the kingside, or overconfidence because of White's innocuous play so far? Whatever the cause, Black often suddenly 'cracks' when facing the King's Indian Attack. That is why it is a more promising opening than the assessments of a computer program would suggest. Few human players likes to defend for hours 'treading water' and waiting for the opponent's attack.</p>

<p class="warning message">QUESTION: Should White worry about his king being attacked the open h-file?</p>
<p class="notification message">ANSWER: As a general rule, you should always worry about your king's safety during a game, but not too much. Here the risk to White is very minimal. The <b>f2-g3-h2</b> shell around his king is solid and his bishop is taking care of the light squares. His knight will go to f3 via d2, further strengthening his defences. And, crucially, Black's pieces aren't on aggressive squares near the white king, and he has no pawn advances available to open up lines. Whilst I could just about imagine Nakamura conducting a brilliant attack if he were playing Black here, he would need the help of some bad moves by White.</p>

</p>
<p>Already we see that Black is missing his light-squared bishop. Advancing the pawn to e5 stops White gaining more space and keeps the bishop on g2 shut in, but it exposes the soft underbelly of the black centre along the a2-g8 and h3-c8 diagonals.</p>

<p class="warning message">EXERCISE: Can you give some reasons why Nakamura chooses to push his h-pawn rather than develop a piece?</p>
<p class="notification message">ANSWER: If the situation in the centre is quiet we don't need to rush our development to hold on to key squares or ward off threats. Here, as is often the case in the KIA, there is a fixed centre pawn structure, with pawns on e4 and e5 blocking each other, and no violent disturbance looming down the d-file. Therefore we are permitted – and required – to use our wing pawns in an imaginative manner.</p>

, Nakamura:</p>
<p>(1) Secures an open diagonal for his bishop from h3-c8.</p>
<p>(2) Creates a base on g5 for his knight.</p>
<p>(3) Empowers a future kingside attack with an <b>h4-h5</b> advance.</p>
<p>If Black chooses to castle queenside

, then the white pawns can quickly become an attacking force with

, etc, gaining time by attacking the bishop on c5. In contrast, Black's kingside pawns are static, a fact emphasised by

<p>I hope you are starting to get a feel for these type of positions. They appear very balanced, with space being equal and both sides having a more or less trouble-free development. However, when we look more closely we notice some important features that give White, if not the better game, then at least more chances to carry out an effective plan in the future.</p>
<div class="chessBoard analysis nobuttons" data-start-fen="r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/2b1p3/4P1b1/2N3P1/PPPN1PBP/R1B1QRK1 w kq - 0 11"></div>
<p class="warning message">EXERCISE: Going back to basics, can you describe the 'important features' I'm talking about?</p>
<p class="notification message">ANSWER: Clearly, I'm not talking about the superficial activity of the players' pieces, because the figures aren't very attractive for White:</p>
<p>Total number of squares the black bishops can move to without being captured: 8.</p>
<p>Total number of squares the white bishops can move to without being captured: 1.</p>
<p>So the black bishops control eight times more squares than the white bishops. But so what? The closed nature of the position means that is better to have pieces on their long-term optimal squares rather than developed quickly.</p>
<p>Looking at the pawn structure, White has the potential to gain space with <b>f2-f4</b>, whilst Black has no equivalent pawn lever. Here we see the value of the pawn on g3 – after a future <b>...e5xf4</b> in response to <b>f2-f4</b>, the recapture <b>g3xf4</b> is possible, keeping the white centre intact and mobile. So we see that the move
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2", this, "g2g3"); ' class="line1">2.g3</span> 
wasn't just a question of 'get the g-pawn out of the way so that I can play <b>Bg2</b>' – the g3-pawn is an important strategic asset due to its support of a future <b>f2-f4</b>. Another good point to g2-g3 is that it stops Black ever playing <b>...Nf4</b>, unless as a sacrifice, of course. In contrast, White can play Nf5, as in most situations the preventive pawn move <b>...g7-g6</b> would loosen the black kingside too much as there's no bishop on g7 equivalent to White's bishop on g2.</p>
<p>The bishop on g2 is shut in, and will stay shut in on g2 until the end of the game. It will have no attacking value at all. But it guards the e4-pawn and, due to its enormous defensive power in shielding the king, gives us the freedom to play moves like <b>f2-f4</b>, knowing that after <b>...e5xf4</b> the recapture g3xf4 won't leave the white king exposed to terrible danger. By bolstering the e4-pawn, no frontal attack by a black rook or the queen will endanger the pawn on e4.</p>
<p>Now look at Black's position. Even if he managed to get the knight on f6 out of the way, the advance <b>...f7-f5</b> would after <b>e4xf5</b> leave him with a weak pawn on e5 and a hole on e4, besides giving the white bishop on e4 more scope. Assuming Black has castled kingside, if he played <b>...g7-g6</b> and <b>...f7-f5</b>, he would be exposing his king to terrible danger – there is no black bishop on g7 to act as bodyguard to the monarch.</p>
<p>So we see that strategically speaking the white bishop on g2 is better placed than the black bishop on c5, despite the latter controlling a lot more squares.</p>
<p>The bishop on c5 is stopping the advance of the f-pawn, but it is only a temporary inconvenience for White, whereas his strategic superiority is permanent. White could play an immediate Kh1 and then <b>f2-f4</b>, but we aren't in a hurry. The bishop on g2 gives us a licence to utilize all our pawns on the kingside. We want to get the h-pawn involved in our initiative. And so:</p>
<p>
 <span onclick='loadMove("r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/2b1p3/4P1b1/2N3PP/PPPN1PB1/R1B1QRK1 b kq - 0 11", this, "h2h3"); ' class="line0">11.h3</span> 
</p>
<p>It doesn't follow that a piece is on a good square just because it is actively placed. Likewise, a piece can be on a passive square, but strategically well placed. The black bishop on g4 is proving a bit of a liability, allowing White to gain more space on the kingside.</p>

<p class="warning message">QUESTION: Why would h2 be chosen rather than h1?</p>
<p class="notification message">ANSWER: White normally plays <b>Kh2</b> in games I've seen with this type of centre. It gets the king off the back rank in case White ever wants to put a rook or the queen on h1, for example, and adds a defender to h3 and g3. The main drawback to Kh2 is if Black ever finds an effective way to sacrifice his knight with a <b>...Nxg4+</b> style sacrifice, which could happen if White has carelessly pushed his pawn to g4.</p>

still looks strong, but it is much easier to win if you let your opponent self-destruct. Tregubov sees no good answer to the threats and so begins a desperate queenside counterattack. The upshot is that he removes his queen from the defence of the second rank, with results that are soon disastrous.</p>

<h3>Black plays a quick ...Nbd7</h3>

It was an unpleasant defeat, but it taught me a valuable lesson which I'd like to share with the reader. The opening actually went quite well for me.</p>

and Black won't survive with his king trapped in the centre.</p>
<p class="warning message">QUESTION: That's a long variation. How can I possibly work it out during a game?</p>
<p class="notification message">ANSWER: First of all, you now know the idea of <b>e2-e4</b> might work if you get a similar situation in your own games – that's a big help. In fact, it's rarely good for Black to combine <b>...Bf5</b> with an early <b>...e7-e5</b>. So your tactical nose should already be sniffing.</p>
<p>Moreover, most of the moves are captures, aren't they? That makes it much easier. It means there are fewer branches of the combination to worry about – it's almost a straight line. Virtually all the action takes place on only two squares, e4 and e5, which further narrows down your focus. As long as you are aware of the potential pin of the black queen and king after a mass of exchanges, the combination can be unravelled.</p>

<p>I guess this move isn't exactly a surprise after reading the notes above. It is a fairly typical scenario in the King's Indian Attack below elite level. White's seemingly lackadaisical opening has caused his opponent's tactical radar to switch off. Black wants space and he takes it, only to meet with an unpleasant surprise.</p>

<p class="notification message">ANSWER: Speaking from a static viewpoint, White has more space and the two bishops. Dynamically speaking he has better communication between his pieces. Why is this so? Because the knight on f8 hinders the co-operation of the black pieces.</p>
<p>White must advance somewhere if he is to win.</p>
<p>Regarding option 'c' it would be nice to be able to breakthrough with <b>f4-f5</b>, as then the bishop on h3 and the rook on f1 would enjoy open lines and the pawn on e5 could well become a passed pawn. Unfortunately, after the preliminary

<p>'Don't stop your opponent playing a bad move'. Black sees that his young opponent is bent on carrying out the wrong plan and so prepares to activate his king's rook.</p>

. Now his queen and both rooks enjoy open lines – and it's all thanks to the generosity of his opponent.</p>
<p>I can still remember that on reaching this position I felt a sense of injustice: I had done nothing wrong, and it was a fault in the logic of chess, not my play, that had made the tide turn against me. It was only when I sat down after the game and calmly examined the position after

that I realized that chess was still a logical game, and my mistaken plan had suffered the fate it deserved. The moral is: be angry when you lose, but blame yourself, not chess – if you look with an open mind at a lost game you can gradually deduce your mistakes.</p>
