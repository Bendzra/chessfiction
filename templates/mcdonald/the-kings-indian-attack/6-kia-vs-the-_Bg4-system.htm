<h2>Chapter Six: KIA Versus the ...Bg4 System</h2>
<p>The 'Slav' method of countering the King's Indian Attack entails Black putting pawns on d5 and c6 to blunt the activity of White's bishop on g2, and quickly developing his own light-squared bishop. In the previous chapter we looked at what happens if the bishop goes to f5. Now it is time to examine <b>...Bg4</b>.</p>
<p>The bishop can be developed to g4 at any time after Black has played <b>...d7-d5</b>: for example,

<p>In playing <b>...Bg4</b> Black removes the bishop from the defence of the queenside, in particular the b7-pawn. In the Reti Opening, White often responds with a quick <b>c2-c4</b>, perhaps in combination with <b>Qb3</b> and <b>Ne5</b>, to try to exploit this. As this is the King's Indian Attack we won't be examining such lines, but it is worth remembering you have this option if you plan to broaden your opening repertoire or want to play a bit more aggressively. Another approach for White not examined here would be to play <b>d2-d4</b> rather than <b>d2-d3</b>, leading to a different type of pawn centre.</p>
<p>In the KIA versus the Caro-Kann, after the moves
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1", this, "e2e4"); ' class="line1">1.e4</span>

Black often chooses a set-up with <b>...d7-d5</b> and, after White's <b>Nf3</b>, <b>...Bg4</b>. This makes the game 'Slav-like'. The reader is therefore invited to study Game 14 of Chapter Three when looking at Part Two of the present chapter (<b>...d5xe4</b> by Black). Game 17 in that chapter might also be worth playing through.</p>
<h3>Black has a choice of three pawn centres</h3>
<p>From the diagram above, a typical sequence is
 <span onclick='loadMove("rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/6b1/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 5", this, "d2d3"); ' class="line0">5.d3</span>

<p>Now Black can arrange his pawn structure in one of three ways.</p>
<p>Firstly, Black can take all the space on offer by playing <b>...e7-e5</b> and keeping a broad centre with a pawn on d5. For example,
 <span onclick='loadMove("r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/3pp3/6b1/3P1NP1/PPPNPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq e6 0 7", this, "e7e5"); ' class="line0">6...e5</span>

. If Black can get away with this then White needs a new opening. So we need the precise
 <span onclick='loadMove("r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/2bpp3/4P1b1/3P1NPP/PPPN1PB1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8", this, "h2h3"); ' class="line0">8.h3!</span>

(Black would be ill advised to avoid this exchange, as made clear in the analysis to Game 28 below)
 <span onclick='loadMove("r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/2bpp3/4P3/3P1QPP/PPPN1PB1/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 9", this, "d1f3"); ' class="line0">9.Qxf3</span>

<p>Black has full development and has stood his ground in the centre, but White has the two bishops and pressure on d5. This scenario is examined in Game 28.</p>
<p>The second option for Black is to equalize the space balance in the centre by playing <b>...e7-e5</b> as above, but meeting White's <b>e2-e4</b> pawn advance by exchanging with <b>...d5xe4</b>. In this way he has fewer commitments in the centre and won't need to give up the bishop-pair. Play could go

<p>The central pawn structure is symmetrical and Black's pieces are all developed, but he has conceded the c4-square to the white knight and opened the d-file, which allows White to keep a slight edge in Game 29.</p>
<p>The third possibility for Black is to renounce the chance to equalize space in the centre and make do with <b>...e7-e6</b>, which completes the Slav triangle of pawns. It is the most solid but least ambitious move. From the second diagram above, play might proceed

<p>White has achieved <b>e2-e4</b>, completed his development by fianchettoing his bishop on b2, and kept a minimal space advantage on the kingside. Black, for his part, has active pieces and is looking for counterplay on the queenside. This is the beginning of Game 31.</p>
<p>Black is quite close to being equal in these scenarios, but White always retains a plus if he plays precisely. He can use his little space advantage, the two bishops, or better coordinated pieces as the starting point of a plan to slowly grind down his opponent.</p>
<h3>White harasses the bishop on g4 with his pawns</h3>
<p>Finally White can try to benefit from a rapid advance of his kingside pawns. In Game 32 after

<p>This is the way Nakamura plays as white in Game 33. He hopes to use his kingside pawns in a direct attack if Black castles kingside, or to profit from the elimination of Black's light-squared bishop after <b>Nxg6</b>. White's scheme is, however, double-edged, especially if Black has played a move order with

However, it turns out that the black centre is still somewhat fragile, and the fact that Black hasn't castled tells against him. We have, though, to be prepared to play sharply, to break open the centre. It isn't good enough to play typical 'quiet' King's Indian Attack moves, which support the strongpoint on e4.

<p>One of the hallmarks of a supreme positional understanding is to know which pieces to exchange off and which to keep on the board. Pantsulaia realizes that his queen is only getting in the way of his light-squared bishop, whereas the black queen is well centralized and blocking any progress along the c-file (for example,
 <span onclick='loadMove("4r1k1/p2n1pp1/2R1qn1p/Np2p3/1P1b4/3P1QPP/P4PB1/4B1K1 b - - 0 21", this, "c2c6"); ' class="line1">21.Rc6</span> 
leaves the a2-pawn hanging).</p>
<p>Note too that a great feel for chess ideas has to be combined with tactical accuracy. If White had played

hits both d3 and f2, when White would do best to retreat his queen back with
 <span onclick='loadMove("5rk1/p2n1pp1/5n1p/Np2pq2/1P1b4/3P1QPP/P1RB1PB1/6K1 b - - 0 21", this, "c6f3"); ' class="line1">21.Qf3</span>

and be a pawn up.</p>
<p>You think the bishop looks a bit odd on e1? I agree! But we have to remember that a flexible use of the pieces is important in any opening, and is especially significant in the King's Indian Attack. White often gets no space advantage, so you have to be aware of all possible squares for the pieces. The bishop may look odd retreating to e1, but it is this passive move that allows White to invade enemy territory with

<p>A common scenario in the King's Indian Attack. Black tries for counterplay, but it is easily neutralized, whereupon he ends up a pawn down in the endgame. It often happens that a player loses patience and lashes out when under nagging pressure. In contrast, if the same player is in tactical danger, say facing a big attack on their king, they will rise to the occasion and find great defensive moves. For this reason it is easy to underestimate White's practical winning chances in the King's Indian Attack. A computer program might tell you that a position is equal, but it could be one that is psychologically difficult for a human to play. Incidentally a lot of Magnus Carlsen's wins occur when he plays on and on in positions where he has a slight edge until his opponent 'cracks'.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the knight on d2 is more passively placed than the one on f3, so giving it preference over the knight on f3 makes sense. Getting it out of the way also facilitates the development of the bishop on c1 and the rook on a1.</p>
<p>If we count the moves, it takes three moves to get the knight from d2 via c4 and e3 to f5, while only two are required to get the knight from f3 via h4 to f5. However, paradoxically, you could argue that the knight gets there from d2 faster as the moves

<p class="warning message">QUESTION: It's funny how we might spend two or even three moves getting a knight to an excellent square, but then we don't hesitate to exchange it for a bishop that's not doing much. Is this exchange really correct?</p>
<p class="notification message">ANSWER: True, it does seem a bit odd. But don't forget the blocked centre is just the first phase of the game. If we want to make progress as White we need to open up lines at some point, and then Black's dark-squared bishop becomes a potent piece. The dark-squared bishop is also a key piece in any plan Black devises, so he'll miss it if it's exchanged. Besides, we have another knight waiting to go to f5 – it's only right it gets its turn as well.</p>

<p>The King's Indian Attack is more effective in practice than the assessment of a computer program would have us believe. Computers don't get bored or frustrated, whereas humans like to be doing something active; it is against our nature to defend passively for many moves without the guidance of a plan. Black often runs out of constructive ideas in this type of centre. Thus both here and in Game 28 in Chapter Five we see a very strong player losing patience and engaging in an adventure with their queen that removes her from the defence of the black camp.</p>

<p>White's plan is simple. He wants to restrain Black's possible counterplay along the d-file or on the kingside. Therefore he first of all contests the open file, driving the black rook away. Then he will manoeuvre his knight to the centre, being careful to keep the black minor pieces at bay. Finally he will try to force Black to weaken his queenside pawns.</p>

<p>Vitiugov sees that threats are looming along the open d-file: White has only to play a move like <b>f2-f3</b> or <b>g3-g4</b> to cut off his bishop's control of the d1-square, followed by <b>Bg5</b> (or perhaps <b>Be3</b> after <b>f2-f3</b>), and then <b>Rd1</b> makes things hard for his queen. An invasion by a knight on d6 would also be in the air.</p>

Black no longer has the killer pawn thrust <b>...f4-f3</b>. It therefore forces Black to exchange his attacking knight for the passive white bishop on g2. Of course, in some structures it would be a positional concession, perhaps a serious one, for White to concede the exchange of his 'Indian' bishop for the knight.

<p class="warning message">EXERCISE: White now has a sequence of moves that allows him to arrange a breakthrough on the queenside. Can you figure it out?</p>

<p>First of all the black queen is forced back to c8 to defend the a6-pawn.</p>

</p>
<p>And, finally, here is the breakthrough. When two experienced players meet, there are essentially only two ways to win a game of chess. The first is to mate the opponent's king with a direct attack, the second is to create a passed pawn and queen it. Kramnik sees that his queen can shepherd home a passed pawn on the a-file, as Black can neither give perpetual check nor use his bishop to help his queen stop the pawn.</p>

there are no more good checks so the passed pawn decides.</p>
<p><b>1-0</b></p>
<p>This game represents Black's worst nightmare when he plays the Slay <b>...Bg4</b> or <b>...Bf5</b> variation. The light-squared bishop was delighted to escape outside the c6/d5/e6 pawn chain, but nothing happened on the kingside and meanwhile it was sorely missed as a defensive piece on the queenside and in the centre.</p>

White has a space advantage due to the pawn on e5, but it is by no means obvious how he can exploit this. He can try to arrange <b>f2-f4</b>, for example, beginning with <b>Nh2</b>, but his centre is unwieldy and can be undermined by a plan such as <b>...Nc7</b>, adding a defender to e6, then <b>...f7-f6</b>.

<p class="warning message">QUESTION: I still don't understand what's wrong with the alternative plan of preparing <b>f2-f4</b>. Doesn't it fit the strategic requirements of the position?</p>
<p>Well, when you see the power of White's f-pawn later in this game it is hard to argue against the plan of advancing the kingside pawns. The trouble is that the King's Indian Attack requires a lot of jockeying for position. At the moment Black's pieces are well coordinated and he has queenside counterplay. A frontal attack with <b>f2-f4</b> has little chance of working against a world champion unless he has been weakened somehow. That's why Sasikiran tries to force a favourable resolution of the queenside battle before turning his attention to the kingside. He knows he mustn't hurry; that would be fatal against Anand.</p>

White would only have a minimal advantage. On the other hand, Black is a world-class player many times over, and wants to fight a bit harder against his fellow Indian Grandmaster. Therefore, rather than see his queenside pawns reduced to (fully defensible) potential targets on a4 and c6, he recaptures with the d5-pawn. This creates a mobile 2-1 pawn majority on the queenside. In return White is allowed to create a broad centre, but Black can take measures to undermine it.</p>

<p>White has deployed his pieces in a familiar manner: both bishops are fianchettoed and he has supported his e4 point with no less than five units. He has avoided playing <b>c2-c3</b> as this would weaken the d3-pawn and shut in his bishop on b2 – besides, it would be an utterly pointless move.</p>
<p>In reply Black has safeguarded his king and developed all his pieces to good-looking squares. There are no weaknesses in his pawn structure. The only potential target in his camp is the pawn on e5, as it cannot easily be defended by another pawn – arranging <b>...f7-f6</b> would be disruptive, too costly in time and involve a weakening of Black's light squares. However the pawn on e5 is well looked after by the black pieces: it is directly defended three times and the bishop on g7 is also ready to come to its aid. Nor is Black suffering from a space disadvantage. White has the bishop-pair, but this is hardly an important factor at the moment.</p>
<p>So far Black has been able to make 'easy' developing moves. I hope it isn't being immodest to say that you or I could have made exactly the same moves as the former FIDE World Champion. Black develops, centralizes, and looks after his centre pawns; there is no mystery here.</p>
<p>But now we have reached the early middlegame stage, and Black has to make his first important strategic decision. This is normally the hardest part of any game of chess, and any decision taken is particularly critical in an opening like the King's Indian Attack, where in view of the slow, strategic nature of the play a change in the nature of the pawn structure can reverberate well into the endgame.</p>

the frontal pressure is off the pawn on e5: if the black knight wanders from d7 there is no chance of being surprised by <b>e4xd5</b>, uncovering the white queen and rook against the e5-pawn followed by <b>Bxe5</b>.</p>
<div class="chessBoard analysis nobuttons" data-start-fen="3rr1k1/ppqn1pbp/2p2np1/4p3/4P3/1P4PP/PBPNQPB1/R3R1K1 b - - 0 15"></div>
<p>This means that the black knight on d7 is relieved of its defensive duty: for example, there is now the plan of <b>...Nc5</b>, perhaps followed by <b>...Ne6</b>, aiming for <b>...Nd4</b>. If White responded to <b>...Ne6</b> with <b>c2-c3</b> he shuts in his bishop and weakens the d3-square. Black's rook is the first to sit on the newly opened d-file, and whilst it is hard to imagine that he will ever be able to attack along it, his potential pressure means that White would probably have to allow the exchange of both pairs of rooks along it, after which his winning chances would be rather small.</p>
<p>The drawback to
 <span onclick='loadMove("3rr1k1/ppqn1pbp/2p2np1/4p3/4p3/1P1P2PP/PBPNQPB1/R3R1K1 w - - 0 15", this, "d5e4"); ' class="line1">14...dxe4</span>

is that White's knight gains access to the c4-square. Because Black has fianchettoed, the d6-square is a potential weakness. For example, White could build up with moves like <b>a2-a4</b>, to deter <b>...b7-b5</b>, then <b>Nc4</b>, <b>Ba3</b>, and <b>Rad1</b>, aiming for an invasion with <b>Nd6</b>. On the kingside, <b>h3-h4</b> and <b>Bh3</b> would increase the scope of the light-squared bishop.</p>

. I've seen players make an exchange of this nature, so it's by no means always a crazy idea. Black doesn't have a light-squared bishop of his own to exploit the absence of White's bishop, so the white king would remain pretty secure after its exchange. And it could be argued in this semi-blocked position that the black knight is of more value than the white bishop. But such reasoning doesn't stand up in this specific case. White wants to keep his bishop because it is helping to keep Black under pressure.</p>

, Black's queenside pawns have become a dead mass rather than a source of counterplay. The black knight on b8 is tied down to the defence of the c6-pawn, hampering the coordination of the black pieces.</p>
<p>The centre and queenside are fairly blocked, meaning Black can hold on OK there. Besides, it makes sense to start an attack as far away as possible from the passive knight on b8. Morozevich understands that he should prepare an assault on the kingside based on the pawn stab with <b>h4-h5</b>. However, he realizes he doesn't have to hurry and for the next ten moves he manoeuvres his pieces around, seemingly unable to decide the best squares to have them on when staging the breakthrough. Of course, it is one long nightmare for Kasimdzhanov who can only wait for the axe to fall.</p>

<p>This is because of the <b>8...e5!</b> advance discussed in the notes to <b>8...e6</b> below. If Black has already gone

<p>A critical moment. At first glance Black's modest pawn move seems very logical. He is going to be deprived of his light-squared bishop, so he builds a solid centre with his pawns on light squares.</p>

<p class="warning message">QUESTION: What is the purpose of this move? Surely Kramnik doesn't think the queen can hold up White's queenside assault by herself?</p>
<p class="notification message">ANSWER: The former world champion wants to put his queen in front of his dark-squared bishop along the b8-h2 diagonal to create threats against the white king.
