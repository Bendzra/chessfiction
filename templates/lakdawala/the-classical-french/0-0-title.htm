<h2>About this Publication</h2>
<p><b>The Classical French: Move by Move</b></p>
<p>This series provides an ideal platform to study chess openings. By continually challenging the reader to answer probing questions throughout the book, the Move by Move format greatly encourages the learning and practising of vital skills just as much as the traditional assimilation of opening knowledge. Carefully selected questions and answers are designed to keep you actively involved and allow you to monitor your progress as you learn. This is an excellent way to study any chess opening and at the same time improve your general chess skills and knowledge.</p>
<p>In this book, International Master Cyrus Lakdawala invites you to join him in studying the French Defence, Classical Variation, which is a popular choice among chess players of all levels. Lakdawala examines in detail the important and commonly played lines, including the Steinitz, McCutcheon and Burn Variations. Using illustrative games and drawing on his own experience with the opening, he explains the main positional and tactical ideas for both sides, provides answers to all the key questions and tells you everything you need to know about successfully playing the Classical French.</p>
<ul>
<li>Essential guidance and training in the Classical French</li>
<li>Provides repertoire options for Black</li>
<li>Utilizes an ideal approach to chess study</li>
</ul>
<p>Cyrus Lakdawala is an International Master, a former National Open and American Open Champion, and a six-time State Champion. He has been teaching chess for over 30 years, and coaches some of the top junior players in the U.S.</p>
