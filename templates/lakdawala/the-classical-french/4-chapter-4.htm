<h2>Chapter Four. Old School Classical Line</h2>
<div class="chessBoard analysis nobuttons" data-start-fen="rnbqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5"></div>
<p>What was once a forgotten discard is now back in fashion. In the Steinitz Old School Classical line, White's universe doesn't operate under rational laws. He or she declines to play <b>f4</b> and in Hypermodern fashion, relies on piece play instead of pawns to control his or her centre, intending to respond to <b>...c5</b> with <b>dxc5</b>, and to <b>...f6</b> with <b>exf6</b>. The battle revolves around coalescence of the now cleared d4- and e5-squares:</p>
<p>1. If White manages to enforce some kind of iron blockade on the two squares, Black stands worse.</p>
<p>2. Conversely, if Black manages to take control and play <b>...e5</b>, our centre rolls forward and we stand better in most cases.</p>
<p>As human beings, we can't help but project our contaminated feelings of "attractive" and "unattractive" on every position we analyse. In this case, perhaps your French Defence-loving writer may be sneaking in a little of his subjective bias. However, from my experience, I find that Bob Dylan's prediction of "The first one now, will later be last" tends to be a reality in this line. White almost always erects the initial blockade and yet if we remain patient, at some point we eventually wrest control over the e5-square and our centre will commence to roll forward.</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: What is the point of avoiding <b>f4</b> ?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>In the good old Romantic perior days, this was actually White's main line:<br>
1. The idea is to support e5 with pieces, not pawns.<br>
2. When Black plays <b>...c5</b>, White responds with <b>dxc5</b> and after <b>...f6</b>, White plays exf6.</p>
<br>
<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: But doesn't this obliterate White's pawn centre?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>It wipes out White's pawn centre, but not his or her control over the centre. White and Black fight furiously over the d4-square, but mainly for dominance of the e5-square. If White seizes control over the square, then he or she may look forward to planting a piece on e5. Black must see to it that this blockade either doesn't occur, or that Black receives some form of compensating counterplay, like maybe down the open f- and/or c-files.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>All according to Hypermodern theory. White hands his opponent over the pawn centre to chip away at it, and attempt to control and blockade d4 and/or e5 with pieces.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at one alternative,

, I later won by expanding on the queenside and fending off White's attempts on the other wing. As usual, Black's unopposed bad light-squared bishop played a prominent role in wresting control over the light squares later in the game, <b>T.Smith-C.Lakdawala, San Diego 1985</b>.;</p>

<p>White seems to have most of his defensive issues under control. Yet, there remains residue which he is unable to eradicate. The advantage tilts towards Black as:<br>
1. His bad bishop is superior to White's unimpressive knight. As the game progresses, we soon see that this is an unequal relationship, since in an ending, a bishop is an amphibious creature, equally adaptable to offence and defence. The same can't be said for a clumsy knight, who is capable of one or the other, but not both.<br>
2. He threatens to exert pressure on the c2-pawn, via <b>...a5</b> and <b>...b4</b>.<br>
3. His king is active and may later infiltrate the kingside light squares.</p>

</p>
<p>Now the weakened light squares fester and proliferate, like the spread of weeds in an overgrown garden. Perhaps White fears the plan: <b>...Kf6</b>, <b>...Bf5</b> and <b>...g5</b>. But his last move creates new light square gashes on the kingside.</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: What are the plusses and minuses of recapturing on f6 with the queen?</p>

<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>
1. Black gains an immediate tempo on the f4-bishop.<br>
2. Black continues to fight for control over the e5-square, unlike the

line, which cedes at least temporary control over e5.<br>
3. By recapturing with the queen, Black does nothing to untangle his queenside by leaving the d7-culprit where it stands. But, I will add that the <b>Nd7</b> isn't as awful as it looks, since Black can later play <b>...Nc5</b> and <b>...Nxd3</b>, both untangling and picking off the bishop pair.</p>

as a tempo gain on the f4-bishop. Yet here we see that it is Black who actually loses a tempo in return. Can you explain this discrepancy?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>White does indeed regain the tempo but at a cost.<br>
1. White's bishop gets diverted from control over the key e5-square.<br>
2. When Black's queen backs off to f7, it conveniently releases the f6-square for the misplaced d7-knight.<br>
3. On f7, Black's queen continues to add heat down the sensitive f-file towards f2, White's traditionally most sensitive square in this variation.</p>

<p>Strained silence breaks in a hostile gesture, with White expending surplus energy by going after Black's king. The spirit may be willing but sometimes the flesh refuses to cooperate with logic's directives. I realized long ago that if I point my finger to an object, my dogs only look at the finger, never the object. As chess players we all suffer such myopic bouts from time to time. Such markedly hostile gestures come with risk and cost, and White faces dire consequences if his attack or initiative should grow cold. Moro loses patience or perhaps overestimates his position and thus offers a semi-dubious pawn sac.</p>
<p>This move is an indicator of White's dissatisfaction with his options:

<p>This is the position Morozevich envisioned when he offered the pawn. Most of his pieces take direct aim at Black's king. Yet the comps don't think much of White's attack and Black's king observes the coming attacking wave with the apocryphal nonchalance of Sir Francis Drake – who was allegedly playing a game of bowls on Plymouth Hoe when he was warned of the approach of the Spanish fleet. His blasé reply that there was plenty of time to finish the game and still beat the Spaniards.</p>

<p>An assessment of the aftermath:</p>
<p>1. Black is up a pawn.</p>
<p>2. Black owns a massive central pawn majority, owns a passed e-pawn, and can create new passers with a future <b>...d4</b>, or with the <b>...f5-f4</b> break.</p>
	<p>3. White's rook is passively tied down to defence of the h2-pawn.</p>
<p>4. Black's king is more actively placed than his counterpart and may be able to infiltrate the kingside light squares in the future.</p>
<p>5. Every White pawn on the board is fixed on the wrong colour of his remaining bishop.</p>
<p>6. The presence of opposite-coloured bishops greatly enhances White's drawing potential.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Black accumulated too many advantages for the opposite-coloured bishops to overcome and we soon discover that White's blockading fortress isn't an insuperable obstacle to Black's hopes.</p>

<p>"Exertion should always be in proportion to what is required," wrote Jane Austen in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. This seems to be the shaky point in Black's case and the move downgrades the market value of Gurevich's initiative by about 75%. Black's move is intended to stop a future Bd4 and f3. Watson gave this move an exclam. Much as it grieves your writer to contradict the notable chessologist, the move looks premature to me, since it weakens the f4-square and allows White to set up a central dark-square blockade.</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: I noticed that Black has yet to play <b>...f6</b>. Is this normal for the <b>...Nxc5</b> lines?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>Yes, avoidance of <b>...f6</b> makes sense since Black's d7-knight has been diverted from the key e5- and f6- squares. Black does play <b>...f6</b> but much later. The philosophy is: White waits for <b>...f6</b> when he responds with exf6 and then attempts to blockade the e5-square, as we have seen in the previous games of this chapter. With avoidance of <b>...f6</b>, Black allows White's cramping e5-pawn to remain on the board, but keeps the position closed in the centre. This generally helps the black side. Meanwhile Black will play both on the queenside and sometimes go for it on the kingside with the <b>...g5!?</b> thrust, as we have seen in the notes.</p>
