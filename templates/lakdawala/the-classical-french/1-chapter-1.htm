<h2>Chapter One. Classical Steinitz: Main Line</h2>
<div class="chessBoard analysis nobuttons" data-start-fen="r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p3/2bpP3/3N1P2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9"></div>
<p>We begin the book with a heavily contested position at the highest levels.</p>
<p>We soon reach an opposite wing attacking position:</p>
<div class="chessBoard analysis nobuttons" data-start-fen="r1bq1rk1/1p1n1ppp/p1n1p3/2bpP3/3N1P1P/2N1B3/PPPQ2P1/2KR1B1R b - h3 0 11"></div>
<p>The areas of agreement between the two parties evaporate and war is imminent. Now comes the time for us to flaunt our attacking prowess. Both parties plan to swoop onto the other's king, like homing pigeons. One wrong move by either side may lead to treacherous conditions escalating at alarming rates, and the spot where our king (or, hopefully, our opponent's king!) stood, may turn into a flaming crater. Each time we score a victory in such a line, our king takes the deep breath of a man who, through sheer luck, avoided certain death that day.</p>
<h3>Key points to keep in mind in this chapter:</h3>
<h4>White's plans:</h4>
<ul>
<li>1. White may play to soften our kingside dark squares and weaken our back rank with <b>h5</b> and <b>h6</b>.</li>
<li>2. White may play for an <b>f5</b> break. The difficulty with implementing this plan is the moment White plays <b>f5</b>, the e5-pawn becomes a chronic weakness.</li>
<li>3. White may play <b>h4</b> and <b>Rh3</b>, which not only prepares a future <b>Rg3</b>, but also helps defend White's king laterally.</li>
<li>4. White may opt for the attacking plan <b>Qf2</b>, intending Bd3 and eventually <b>Qh4</b>, taking direct aim at h7.</li>
</ul>
<p>Black's position also comes well-armed for combat.</p>
<h4>Our plans:</h4>
<ul>
<li>1. Black can play <b>...Bxd4</b>, followed by <b>...b5</b>, <b>...b4</b>, <b>...a5</b> and <b>...Ba6</b>, which begins a pawn storm against White's king and activates our dormant "bad" c8-bishop, which as we see in this chapter, really isn't as bad as previously advertised.</li>
<li>2. After we achieve step one, we load up major pieces down the open c-file, tying White down to defence of c2. We often do this in conjunction with <b>...a4</b> and <b>...b3</b>, or <b>...a4</b> and <b>...a3</b>, which weakens c3 and the dark squares around White's king.</li>
<li>3. We must develop a feel for when to play the counter <b>...f6</b>, since playing <b>...f6</b> keeps our king safer and generates play down the f-file, and when to hold back on the move as it also weakens e6 and e5.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we are, the Classical French, the Winawer's twin brother.</p>
<div class="chessBoard analysis nobuttons" data-start-fen="rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4"></div>
<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: What are the main characteristics which differentiate Winawer from Classical?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>
1. The most important difference is that in Winawer, Black usually hands over his or her all-important dark-squared bishop with <b>...Bb4</b> and later <b>...Bxc3+</b>, which damages White's structure but also weakens Black on the dark squares. The Classical is less extreme. We usually hang on to our dark-squared bishop but don't inflict structural damage.<br>
2. Even so, the positions are no less violent than Winawer, since in Classical, we often end up with opposite wings attack, with White going queenside and us castling kingside. (In the Winawer Poisoned Pawn Line, Black also frequently castles long and White's king usually stays in the centre)<br>
3. IM Byron Jacobs writes in <i>Starting Out: The French</i>: "It is a curious thing but the Classical has always been less popular among amateur players than the Winawer, even though the Classical is currently more popular than the Winawer at elite level!" Well, maybe the players at the top know something we don't. I employed Winawer as my main French for over 30 years. The Classical was utilized only as a second string, backup surprise weapon. Having researched for this book, I am beginning to wish I played Classical more often, since I endured a lot of dark-square suffering in Winawers over the decades!</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: The d7-knight looks out of place and promises to turn into a problem piece, correct?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>Very true, our d7-knight tends to gum up development. Yet there may be a promising future for the knight:<br>
1. After <b>...c5</b> and <b>...cxd4</b>, our knight may head for c5, where it eyes important squares like a4, b3, d3 and e4.<br>
2. After <b>...c5</b>, <b>...cxd4</b>, <b>...a6</b> and <b>...b5</b>, we can transfer our knight to b6 where it overlooks attacking squares a4 and c4.<br>
3. After <b>...c5</b>, <b>...cxd4</b> and <b>...f6</b>, we undermine White's control over e5. If White plays <b>exf6</b> we may respond with <b>...Nxf6</b>, when the knight returns to polite society.</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: I don't mean to be a pessimist, but how exactly are we going to develop our other problem piece: the not-so-pretty c8-bishop?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>For now the c8-bishop finds its freedom of movement circumscribed within tight boundaries, but not forever. Not to worry. Believe it or not, this "bad" c8-bishop nearly always finds employment elsewhere, with the following choice of plans:<br>
1. Black plays <b>...a6</b>, <b>...b5</b> and then later <b>...b4</b> and <b>...a5</b>. This allows for <b>...Ba6</b>, when we swap off our theoretically bad bishop for White's powerful f1–counterpart.<br>
2. Black plays a future <b>...f6</b>. After <b>exf6</b> and <b>...Nxf6</b>, we blast our way out by forcing <b>...e5</b> later on.<br>
3. In Plan #2, our bad bishop embraces virtue by weaving its way out with <b>...Bd7</b>, <b>...Be8</b> and usually <b>...Bg6</b>, where it takes aim at White's king and c2, while keeping our own king more secure.</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: Does Black have to castle kingside, into this attack?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>Pretty much, the answer is yes, since we attempt a corresponding attack on the other side of the board with <b>...c5</b>, <b>...cxd4</b>, <b>...a6</b> and <b>...b5</b>.</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: But doesn't an <b>...f6</b> break hand us a backward e6-pawn?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>Correct but few desirable things in life are free. We do indeed take on a backward e6-pawn. In exchange, we unravel and generate play down the f-file. Even though e6 is admittedly an eyesore, I don't recall a single game where I actually later lost the pawn. The greater danger to us is that White may manage to use e5 as a hole for his or her pieces. Still, from my experience, the damage tends to be more cosmetic than real for Black.</p>

<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>
Black remains active and soon generates counterplay along the f-file. Of course this assessment is purely intuitive on my part, but having played French for over three decades, I stick by it! Houdini also assesses at even, so I have an ally to my claim!

<p>The person cops hate the most is the perpetual suspect, who always seems to evade conviction of the crime, due to lack of hard evidence. Black's e-pawn, somehow fits this description. Just when it appears as if White is holding a draw, the advanced e-pawn pulls a fast one, drawing White's king one critical tempo away from the queening square.

1. Black follows the principle: If you exert pressure on a wing but your tied-up opponent continues to hold, then open a second front. Black intends <b>...Qh4!</b>, after which White's overworked forces experience difficulty covering threats on both wings.<br>
2. Black defends b4, which frees the knight to swing into b5, via c7.</p>

<p>An error may have been committed in the distant past, yet echoes of its effects continue to linger in the present. White incurs further debt which he can ill afford. It's always a sobering moment when we discover that our plans aren't working out the way we intended. In such cases, falling back to passive defence is the strategy all natural attackers resolutely loathe. So Topalov lashes out, fearing that if he remains passive, Black may continue to strengthen his position. But in doing so, he undermines the integrity of his central structure.</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: The queen is already developed. Why move it again rather than to develop?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>
1. At some point, White would like to play <b>Bd3</b>, which is impossible with the queen on d2, since the d4-pawn hangs.<br>
2. White prepares to swing the queen to h4, in the vicinity of Black's king.<br>
3. White's queen/bishop line-up on the g1-a7 diagonal keeps an eye out on key dark squares d4, c5 and b6. Black, in some instances, may experience some difficulty engineering <b>...Nc5</b> or <b>...Nb6</b> later on.</p>

, Watson rates this position at "+/=", while I see it as dynamically balanced, for the following reasons:<br>
1. Black can eliminate White's bishop pair with <b>...Ba6</b>. This could leave White with the slightly inferior minor piece in the ending.<br>
2. The e5-pawn may become a target if queens come off the board.<br>
3. Black owns the f-file and soon, the c-file too for his rooks. Conclusion: White's kingside attacking chances seem to balance out with Black's long-term strategic superiority (if he or she doesn't get mated!).</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>EXERCISE</b> (combination alert): After this move, we observe tell-tale signs that White's position is in the throes of decline. White is willing to endure privation to further his cause, but this proves to be a waste of resources. A move based on the philosophy: A key requisite of an insurgency is the ability to establish a base from which to launch guerrilla attacks. Karjakin, who continues to frolic in a golden mist of optimism, doesn't allow trivial matters – like the fact that he has no attack – to keep him from aggressive overtures. White's rash move was condemned by the noted chessologist as well. The weakening of White's pawns outweighs the attacking factor and his structure grows rigid, as if stricken with tetanus. How can Black show that White had overextended on his last move?</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>EXERCISE</b> (planning): Sorrow's great torment is remembrance of past happiness. I bet White at this stage regretted his decision to lock the kingside. A list of White's troubles, in ascending order of importance:<br>
1. White's position is unable to withstand a two-pronged assault. Black's major pieces managed to infiltrate and the h5 and f4 weaknesses cry out for attention, the way a toddler throws a tantrum when her mother walks by the mall's toy store without entering it.<br>
2. Black's passed d-pawn, along with his advanced king, insure that rook endings or king and pawn endings will be lost for White, should a few pieces be removed from the board.<br>
3. White can't do anything but wait. Such low-intensity attacks can actually be more potent than wild binges, mainly because prolonged defence has a way of enticing the defender to lower his or her guard, due to underestimation of the attack's true potential.</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: Why would White voluntarily withdraw a centralized piece?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>White's move is based on two points:<br>
1. Black isn't going to be tempted to swap away his good bishop for the e3-counterpart.<br>
<b>Principle</b>: The side with more space should avoid exchanges.<br>
2. White fights for control over the key c5-square, denying Black ...Nc5 attacking ideas later. Let's not underestimate it, since this line is one of White's highest scoring in the Classical French. However, the move costs White time, which is a clear factor in opposing wing attacks.</p>

<p>These opposite wing attacks, so common to Classical French, have a nasty way of raising our blood pressure to levels which our doctor wouldn't approve. The bishop, who normally displays a gift of hiding his true feelings, this time uncharacteristically refuses to keep up appearances and indulges in a tantrum. His philosophy on regicide undergoes a jarring modification, as he resolves to assassinate Black's king. In some situations we lay aside notions of multi-layered plans and just reach for a blunt instrument. So Anand decides to waive formalities and sacs. The black king's cover is soon ripped asunder as White's queen and two rooks make a mad dash at Black's seriously exposed king. However, the sac is only good enough to deliver perpetual check.</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: Can White afford such a leisurely defensive move in an opposite wing attacks situation?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>It isn't really a loss of a tempo. If you look back on the previous games of this chapter, White tossed in Kb1 at some point or another in the majority of the games. By playing it early, White plays a useful defensive move and seeks to keep options open, while gathering intelligence on how Black plans to structure his operations.</p>
