<h3>Why Play the French?</h3>
<p>If the human race is the by-product of Darwinian selection, where only the fittest of the species survive, then why is it that on the chess board - a Darwinian dystopia if there ever was one, defensive players win just as often or more than belligerent attackers? My theory is that defensive players - and we French players perfectly fit this category, are better suited to survive than our aggressively inclined counterparts, who have a nasty way of gambling away their lives by chasing some folly. Children want a 100% share and tend to pick fights with other children over trivial matters. As adults, having grown wiser (and perhaps also more devious!), we learn to pick our fights. Sometimes our self-interest lies in the surrender of a minor skirmish, in order to later win the war. The Classical French embraces this philosophy. From the start, we cede White space and by default, attacking chances, all in order to counterattack later.</p>
<p>Some players stick to one opening scheme their entire chess lives, meeting
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1", this, "e2e4"); ' class="line1">1.e4</span> 
with Pirc, Modern Defence, Scandinavian, Alekhine's Defence, Caro-Kann, Sicilian, or
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6 0 2", this, "e7e5"); ' class="line1">1...e5</span> 
. I'm the opposite as my ADHD-infected brain tends to amble to anything and everything in the opening. In fact, I'm hard pressed to come up with an opening, however esoteric, which I haven't played. But if you ask me what my favourite opening is, I faithfully answer: The French Defence (except I spell the word defense with an 's'!). I have yet to discover another strategically rich opening which invariably flares into irrational tactics later on, the way the French does. If understanding the French is a science, then it is a dark science. The panoramic scope of potential structures is staggering and that is what fascinates me the most about the opening. Whenever I play the French, I get that restful feeling of being completely at home. The French has been a key player in my opening repertoire since the early 70's and I never tire of its adventures or even its misadventures. It takes a coldblooded - I would go as far as to call it reptilian - spirit to navigate and survive the violent corridors of the Classical (or any other!) French Defence, an opening of docile outer appearances but great inner turmoil, always on the verge of calamity. After playing the French for a while, it may appear to you that our opening is nothing more than a series of crises for Black, and you would be correct in your assumption. But there is also great reward, should we happen to survive our ordeal, since the opening contains within its core a hidden, coiled spring mechanism. We first get pushed back and then later emerge bullying our previous bullier.</p>
<h4>The Dark Square question: Why play Classical over the Winawer?</h4>
<p>The Winawer (
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1", this, "e2e4"); ' class="line1">1.e4</span> 
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2", this, "e7e6"); ' class="line1">e6</span> 
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3 0 2", this, "d2d4"); ' class="line1">2.d4</span> 
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6 0 3", this, "d7d5"); ' class="line1">d5</span> 
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3", this, "b1c3"); ' class="line1">3.Nc3</span> 
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4", this, "f8b4"); ' class="line1">Bb4</span> 
) is currently more popular than the Classical. However, if you look at the choice of top GMs, they tend to lean toward the Classical. The reason may be it is slightly more strategically sound than Winawer, since Black retains greater control over the dark squares. Back in the 80's, I asked my friend IM Doug Root why he played Classical French rather than the Winawer. He answered: "I like my dark squares!" In the Winawer - which has always been my main French and Classical my secondary - Black, in the main lines plays <b>...Bb4</b> and usually later <b>...Bxc3+</b>, handing White the bishop pair and control over the dark squares to inflict damage to the structure. In the Classical, we don't get the better structure, but we do hang on to our precious dark-squared bishop - and with it, our dark squares.</p>
<h4>Cramped Quarters</h4>
<p>In the Classical French, we willingly hand White an early space advantage as soon as e5 is played. This lack of space can be chaffing and it's easy to experience suffocating, submerged feelings, not knowing which direction is up - the place of life-giving air. If we allow the asphyxiation to continue without fighting back with undermining freeing ideas like <b>...c5</b> and <b>...f6</b>, we risk getting squeezed and passing bluely, from this life to the next. It feels as if the yin/yang ratio is askew and we often wish our side could use a little more yang in the formula. But realize this: Our yang is there. It simply arrives late. The nature of the French is to hand White an early (and often temporary) initiative. Ours arrives later, often in the form of withering counterattacks. Those who play French begin to sense something formidable behind the opening's seemingly passive exterior.</p>
<p>The French is a species of opening which has a nasty habit of upending those who don't know their theory. The Classical French is one of those libraryish openings we just can't wing through in an abstract or absent manner. Black's demeanour manifests outwardly of meek servility, all the while inwardly of a conspirator plotting revenge. Sometimes we arrive in positions we just can't wrestle our way out of. The best course of action is to remain loose and allow White's fearful initiative wave to pass over us and only then counterattack. Our opening is not for those whose haughty spirit rankles and chafes at the first sign of an opponent's initiative.</p>
<p>The staggering enormity and scope of the lines we must master is intimidating. It's critical we glean understanding of the inner workings of each opening line, not just memorizing it, like a parrot, who can repeat, yet lacks the ability to understand what she is saying. Each chapter contains its separate joys and trials. I once read that the monk Gregor Mendel, the father of modern genetics flunked his teaching certificate examination in both geology and zoology! Moral: We all sometimes forget our lines! So let's not lose heart if we sometimes omit a key move or idea and get upended in a theoretical duel.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at our Classical French battlegrounds:</p>
<h3>Main line Classical</h3>
<div class="chessBoard analysis nobuttons" data-start-fen="r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p3/2bpP3/3N1P2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 1"></div>
<p>The Classical Main line is a variation imbibed with the baffling suspense of a good mystery novel and the frantic urgency of a thriller, especially since opposite wings castling steps up the intrigue. I like Black's chances, with our open c-file, the possibility of attacking with <b>...a6</b> and later <b>...b5</b>, and also the fact that we can meet White's coming attack with a timely <b>...f6</b> or <b>...f5</b> counter.</p>
<h3>The Shirov-Anand Line</h3>
<div class="chessBoard analysis nobuttons" data-start-fen="r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P1P2/2P5/PP2N1PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1"></div>
<p>Chapter Two has the disorienting quality of being lost in an unfamiliar city. We reach a position more closely associated with the f4 lines of Tarrasch, rather than Classical.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:right">"If I Swallow Anything Evil, Put Your Finger Down My Throat..."</p>
<h3>The 8...Qb6 Poisoned Pawn Line</h3>
<div class="chessBoard analysis nobuttons" data-start-fen="r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/1qn1p3/3pP3/3N1P2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 1"></div>
<p>In chaotic positions, it sometimes appears to us as if the correlation of cause and effect breaks down. Of course this is an illusion, bred by our own ignorance. The <b>8...Qb6!?</b> Poisoned Pawn Line appears to strain the fulcrum of common sense, until it snaps. The cause of every effect still remains, even when we can't see it. I fear Paul Morphy, if he were alive today, would vomit upon viewing Black's decision to go pawn-hunting, violating the ABC's of opening principle in the most flagrant manner possible. A warning: Your losses in this line could be unpleasantly memorable. The choice of opening lines yields clues to the motivations of their devotees. The Poisoned Pawn Line tells us the following: People who play this line may harbour the criminal gene and are willing to take excessive risks to steal a mere pawn. I freely admit that Black's last move, <b>8...Qb6</b>, fishing for b2, is one of outlandish design. Ambition has its costs and in the Poisoned Pawn Line, we are willing to pay the price. However, lately in high-level games, top-ten-ranked GMs are experiencing a devil of a time proving even an edge for White. So what first began in the 1980s as a sleazy side line, designed to waylay unsuspecting victims, may now have gone legit, championed by no less than the likes of GM Hikaru Nakamura, who uses it as a drawing weapon! A bearer of stunning news loves to evoke shock and terror in his or her audience, so brace yourself when I declare to you: Black's pawn grab is sound (at least at the time of this writing). Black's queen is the secretly genius jester in a court of unaware fools. She continues to play dumb, all the while, laughing inwardly, as she sneaks away with a pawn.</p>
<h3>The Russian Roulette line</h3>
<div class="chessBoard analysis nobuttons" data-start-fen="r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p3/2PpP3/5B2/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 1"></div>
<p>White's once dominant centre is slowly chipped away from the flanks, with <b>...c5</b> and eventually <b>...f6</b>. The game revolves around White's ability to control the e5-square.</p>
<h3>Burn variation 6...gxf6</h3>
<div class="chessBoard analysis nobuttons" data-start-fen="rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pB2/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6"></div>
<p>In the Burn variation <b>6...gxf6</b>, we grab the bishop pair and agree to a disruption of our pawn centre. We concentrate on Morozevich's specialty of the <b>...a6</b> and <b>...b5</b> plan, with rich, unbalanced play.</p>
<h3>The McCutcheon</h3>
<p>Our next three diagrams represent some of our most difficult strategic challenges in the book. These are positions conducive to experimentation and we simply go where the road takes us!</p>

<h3>The History of the French</h3>
<p>Our opening took its birth in 1834, in a correspondence match between London and Paris, when the French player, Chamouillet, influenced his teammates to respond to

. According to my database, the French today is Black's third most popular response to

, behind the Sicilian and

<p>The fifth rank – the opponent's territory – is that violation of the invisible barrier of the neutral zone, which we all desire to cross in the opening.</p>

<p>If a GM played this move today, I would hand it a '?!' mark, but it's easy to forget that in those days, there were no opening books and no databases with easy-to-pull-up stats. White can't unravel so easily without a price levied upon his centre.</p>

<p>The sound of a cannon salvo rouses White from his nap, with a start. The ambitious rook seeks to alter and upgrade the designation of his job description, from "Knight of the Realm" to 'Universal Overlord'. Of course the temptation to sac is overwhelming (especially when it is absolutely sound, as in this case!), like a pizza delivery driver who didn't get a chance to eat lunch, and who gazes lovingly at the pizza he must hand over to an undeserving stranger. We don't always require gigabytes of information to make a decision. Sometimes the eye sees and we simply feel the correct answer, rather than compute it. I'm certain Paulsen didn't need to work out all the lines of this very promising exchange sac (it almost isn't a sac, since he gets so much for it!).</p>

<p>The c1–square proves to be a major centre of commerce. Black could have been more patient in the payoff part of the process.</p>

<p>A war council of the nation's brightest minds agrees that a queening race is White's sure-fire path to victory. The transcripts: "It would be the wisest course of action to engage Black in a queening race," councils White's not-so-bright king, who many believe was dropped on his head when he was a baby. "Yes, our swift and faithful a-pawn will surely reach promotion before Black's slowpoke e-pawn," chime in White's yes-men rooks. "Agreed. Victory is within sight with this cunning plan," adds White's queen, whose multiple "honorary" PhDs do not fool anyone.</p>

<p>Boy, White's last move is the epitome of a feeble protest. The white king believes that people regard his silent nature as one of a profoundly deep thinker, while most attribute his silence to imbecility. One gets the feeling that people had a lot of time on their hands in the year 1877. I'm not sure this move is as effective as Schallopp originally believed. We establish the following crucial facts:</p>
<p>1. Black queens by force.</p>
<p>2. By queening, Black delivers checkmate.</p>
<p>3. White seems to be doing his best at ignoring numbers 1 and 2.</p>

<p>Mate!"I am God's turnspit, little man; you are the roasting pig, with apple in mouth," declares the newly coronated queen, self-importantly.</p>
