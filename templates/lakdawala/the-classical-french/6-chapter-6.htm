<h2>Chapter Six. McCutcheon Main Line</h2>
<div class="chessBoard analysis nobuttons" data-start-fen="rnbqk2r/ppp2p2/4p1pp/3pP3/3Pn1Q1/2P5/P1PB1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 9"></div>
<p>In this chapter, we choose to enter one of the most complicated lines of the book. In the McCutcheon, we observe a clear demarcation: The e5-pawn insures that the kingside is White's playground, while we as Black, must generate counterplay in the centre and on the queenside. To top it off, as in the above diagram, we voluntarily saddle ourselves with weak kingside dark squares and nurse them fearfully. But there is good news for us as well. It is not only our side who takes liberties with the pawn structure. Unlike the Winawer, in the main line McCutcheon, we soon eliminate White's monster dark-squared bishop. On top of that, we lure our opponent's king to d2, where it will never feel safe after our <b>...c5</b> and <b>...Qa5</b> ideas.</p>
<div class="chessBoard analysis nobuttons" data-start-fen="rnbqk2r/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3pP3/3Pn1Q1/2P5/P1PB1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 8"></div>
<p>As the diagram shows, we enter battle between the irresistible force versus the immovable object. We swap one problem for another by defending g7 with <b>...Kf8</b>, rather than the structurally weakening <b>...g6</b>. This keeps our dark squares intact at the following costs:</p>
<p>1. Loss of castling privileges.</p>
<p>2. We risk that our h8-rook may be out of play for quite a while.</p>
<p>3. Our stationary king provides White with a somewhat fixed attacking target. However, we also have access to a curious plan of <b>...c5</b> and <b>...c4</b>, after which we seal the queenside and then run our king (who does his best imitation of a shuttlecock in a badminton match) there after securing our kingside pawns.</p>
<p>In both diagrams, White's attackers and our counterpunchers pour forth simultaneously, like an insect infestation in this bug-eat-bug world. The positions are very easy to misplay by an underprepared opponent. Through intense study of this chapter, we hone our skills and decide to take on Black's side. We may see our opponents reach dizzying heights of futility in their attempts to storm our not-so-easy-to-mate king.</p>

<p>We will also look at the sensible-looking bishop recapture after <b>6...Nxc3</b>, which keeps White's pawn structure undamaged, but is ultimately too insipid a concept to be a threat to Black's counterattack on the queenside.</p>

White has an option to undermine further with f4, which he can't do so with a knight on f3.

<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: Isn't this a dead draw? After all, it's four pawns versus four, all on the same side.</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>Black's one large bonus in the McCutcheon is his superior pawn structure. In this instance Black has excellent winning chances due to the following factors:<br>
1. White is in effect a pawn down since Black's d5-pawn holds back a pair of doubled, isolated white c-pawns.<br>
2. White's king is tied to defence of the c3-pawn.<br>
3. The black king's participation only adds adhesion to the steadily growing, nasty sentiment against White's position. Black may soon puncture White's attempted kingside fortress with either <b>...g4</b>, or <b>...e5-e4</b>, when Black's king infiltrates and creates a passed pawn. White will have difficulty halting it (since his king is tangled up in defence of the c3-pawn).</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: Isn't this too large a concession? After all, now White knows the black king's address. Won't it be easy to whip up an attack with the space advantage?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>White usually does get to attack in this line but again at a cost:<br>
1. Black's position, including the kingside, remains for now weakness-free.<br>
2. In order to attack, White must mass all available forces on the kingside. This strategy by default, leaves White's queenside and centre vulnerable to counterattacks.<br>
3. White's king is on d2, not such a safe square. Black has a choice of two plans:<br>
a) Play <b>...c4</b>, driving White's potent d3-bishop off its dangerous diagonal with tempo. Then play for a <b>...b5</b>, <b>...b4</b> break, undermining the c3-pawn and by default, the d4-pawn.<br>
b) A secondary plan for Black, which we examine in this chapter is <b>...cxd4</b>, followed by <b>...Qa5+</b>, <b>...b6</b> and <b>...Ba6</b>. Then we swap away one of White's best attackers with <b>...Bxd3</b>. This not only helps our king but also leaves the c2-pawn vulnerable.</p>

<p>This is the position Akopian banked on before entering this line. I don't blame him. If a student asked me to evaluate White's position, I would say advantage White (and be absolutely wrong!). For the exchange, White gets:</p>
<p>1. Two connected central passers.</p>
<p>2. The possibility of a <b>Bb7</b> raid.</p>
<p>3. A dominant king.</p>
<p>4. The illusion that White's bishop seems to be able to deal with Black's passed h-pawn, while his king blockades the passed f-pawn. However, Black stands better and the sac is like a man who sells his shares of a goldless goldmine for 10 cents on the dollar, and then discoversto his horror the following week, that a rich vein has just been struck. Black's single plus in the position: His rook is more valuable than White's bishop! No position is too chaotic for a comp to analyse, and they say Black is winning, despite appearances!</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: You mainly use Houdini for your books. Is that the strongest program?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>Most first grade children know more about computers than your comp-challenged writer. My best bet is to quote an authority for a possible answer. GM Larry Kaufman, co-author of the Komodo engine (and the creator of the evaluation function for Rybka 3) opined in a recent interview, "Komodo is best at evaluating middlegame positions accurately once the tactics are resolved. Stockfish seems to be best in the endgame and in seeing very deep tactics. Houdini is the best at blitz and at seeing tactics quickly. Rybka is just obsolete; I like to think of Komodo as its spiritual descendant, since I worked on the evaluation for both, although the rest of the engines are not similar. Fritz is just too far below these top engines to be useful." I have a feeling my Fritz and Rybka engines aren't going to be happy about this interview and may write Kaufman a nasty email. In my opinion, all the comps mentioned are just fine at the club or internet level for general study, since the differences may be too subtle to really matter, unless you are one of those obsessive players who spends three hours working out some detail for a line on the 23rd move.</p>

<p>This is a rare line which caught my eye while doing research for this book. Black's move has only been played eight times and has been championed by super-GMs Vallejo Pons and Nepomniachtchi. So far, it has scored a whopping 75% for Black.</p>
<div class="chessBoard analysis nobuttons" data-start-fen="rnbq1k1r/pp3pp1/4p2p/3pP3/3p2Q1/2PB1N2/P1PK1PPP/R6R w - - 0 12"></div>
<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: What are the ideas and benefits of the move over the normal <b>...c4</b> plan?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>The following ideas are behind the move:<br>
1. It follows the principle: Counter in the centre when attacked on the wing. Depending on which way White captures the d4-pawn, Black plans either ...Qa5+ or <b>...Qg5+</b>.<br>
2. Black sheds himself of his bad bishop with <b>...b6</b> and <b>...Ba6</b>, then plays down the c-file.<br>
3. After a bishop swap, Black can take advantage of the c4-hole with <b>...Nc6</b>, <b>...Na5</b> and <b>...Nc4</b>. If White plays <b>cxd3</b> in response to <b>...Bxd3</b>, then White is in effect a pawn down since his kingside majority is frozen, while Black owns a healthy two to one majority on the queenside.</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: Here we go again. What is the criterion of when it's okay for us to make this swap?</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: It feels to me like Black continues with a principle-transgressing outrage:<br>
1. Black's last move fixes White's damaged pawns.<br>
2. Black virtually begs White to enter a good knight versus bad bishop ending.<br>
Hence, Black's outlook with his last move balances a compound of optimism and insufficient means. Therefore, White holds a clear plus, based on superior space and most importantly, the better minor piece. Am I correct in my assessment?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>I prefer Black. Declaring White's victory here is a bit like the historian who writes about world events which have yet to happen.</p>
<br>
<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: On what do you base your rosy assessment for Black?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>Outwardly it does indeed appear that in a moment of puritanical self-reproach, Black broke all Ten Commandments and lapsed in all the seven deadly sins. But before we take White's inevitable victory for granted, let's examine the facts: First of all, I question your premise that Black's bishop is bad. I remind you of Tartakower's quip about the worst bishop still being better than the best knight! Only two of Black pawns are fixed on light squares – not enough to label the bishop as "bad". I envision it reaching e4, after <b>...f6</b>, <b>...Be8</b> and <b>...Bg6</b>, which happens routinely in French structures.</p>

1. Black chases away White's dangerous light-squared bishop from its best diagonal (although it can crop up on h5 and g4 later).<br>
2. Black closes the queenside, mainly because this is where Black plans to run his king, as soon as he stabilizes his kingside.</p>

<p>Out of nothingness, White managed to produce an unbreachable fortress, which doesn't seem to have a beginning, middle or end. Black does his best to make progress with a multi-step plan:</p>
<p>Step 1: Transfer the knight to f7, where it attacks the g5-pawn and ties White's knight to the f3-square.</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>EXERCISE</b> (critical decision/planning): Black intends to manoeuvre his knight to b6 and then pick off the a4-pawn. White has a choice of two reactions:<br>
<b>Plan A</b> – Transfer White's king to h3 and then pick off Black's h- and f-pawns. When Black's knight wins the a4-pawn, he will cover the c3-pawn with <b>Nd2</b> and <b>Nb1</b>.<br>
<b>Plan B</b> – White's king can reach the a3-square, protecting a4 before Black's knight has a chance to get to b6. So this means White's knight is left to guard against the advance of Black's passed h-pawn.<br>
One plan draws; the other loses. Consider carefully, since this one isn't so easy to solve. This is a position more suited to precise calculation, rather than carefree rapture (although even if you do take a wild guess, you still have a 50% chance of getting it right!). Which direction should White's king go? Left or right?</p>

<p>Like most kings, this one isn't used to taking orders. The white king's tenure as leading dissident was a short one. Previously, move followed move without event. But this last move throws White's world out of its orderly routine. The king weaves left, when he should go right.</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>EXERCISE</b> (planning/combination alert): When a magician performs a trick before an audience of children, he knows it is merely illusion, while the children may believe it to be real. White's king arrived just in the nick of time and all looks well for the defenders. This isn't the reality and White soon discovers he must restrain premature jubilation. If we closely dissect White's happiness, we come to realize he has little cause for it. Black forced a win here. How?</p>

<p>This is a perfect example of the principle we discussed earlier: When one party defends weaknesses on both sides of the board, keep switching from wing to wing, since it is much more difficult for the defence to calibrate against the changing threats. In this instance, White's king is just too slow to reach the kingside and White is helpless against the coming combination.</p>

<p>If something bothered you for a long time, speaking your mind on the issue can be a cathartic experience. The oversight committee is comprised of only one member who matters – Black's knight. White's kingside is disgorged of all able-bodied defenders. If I remember my high school Euclidean geometry correctly, you can divide a parcel of space in half and then subdivide the halves in half, ad infinitum. To White, who seems to be losing territory at an alarming rate, this theory rings true. A second pawn falls and the blockade is smashed, since Black's king is free to enter the kingside.</p>

<p>It's not easy to escape our true nature, as displayed by Korchnoi's reverence – one may call it obsession – with inflicting chaos in virtually every game he plays. He indulges in provocation merrily. Most players would consider it necessary to take precautions but Korchnoi always seems to go his own way as he wilfully neglects to do so. This move in reality deserves a "?!" mark, but not when it's Korchnoi, who like Lasker before him, thrives on confusing opponents with slightly unsound ideas!</p>

<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: What is so strange about this move?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>Two things come to mind:<br>
1. In this structure, Black normally leaves the a5-square open for the a-pawn to break with <b>...a5</b> and eventually <b>...b4</b>.<br>
2. Only a very confident defender would deliberately move his queen away from the kingside, with White massing in that sector.</p>
<br>
<p class="warning message"><b>QUESTION</b>: It feels like playing the queen to a5 is pointless for Black. What benefit is derived?</p>
<br>
<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>Korchnoi, a notorious pawn grabber, perhaps contemplates tying White's rook to defence of the a2-pawn. Also, he may entertain ideas like <b>...Qb5</b> and <b>...Qb2</b>, chasing White's rook from a1 and then grabbing the a2-pawn. Of course, this takes time and Black may well get mated on the other side of the board in the meanwhile. However, this is just how Korchnoi operates, always provoking and always stretching limits. Only a player endowed with phenomenal calculating ability can get away with this kind of idea.</p>

<p>Players who must win every game (Korchnoi, Larsen and Fischer come to mind) are greatly admired for their fighting spirit. I always regard a chess player with an overdeveloped competitive urge as a character flaw (although this hippy, love-and-light philosophy may be one reason I'm not a GM)! In this case, we see Korchnoi mellowing with age, satisfied with a draw with the Black pieces. However, his young, ambitious opponent isn't intimidated by the fact that the tournament in which he participates is named after his legendary opponent!</p>

<p>Black's cavalier pawn grab is a move which virtually invokes punishing sanctions. The terms of transaction of this line of the McCutcheon clearly stipulate – guard your king before wandering off on some crazy adventure! This time, Korchnoi, who is just asking for it, gets the question mark. The mood is upon him and he proceeds in the same reckless manner as his previous moves. Black deliberately allows White the coming sacrificial breakthrough, betting on his queenside counterplay to balance the game.</p>

<p class="notification message"><b>ANSWER</b>:<br>I prefer Black, but the objective evaluation is probably equal. Let's tackle your arguments point by point:<br>
1. White's extra space may disappear when Black tosses in a timely <b>...f6</b>.<br>

<p>The bored queen seeks diversion from her humdrum everyday life. This move, perhaps based on the philosophy "the best victory is a bloodless one!?", is a little like a tennis pro training on a clay court when the championship is to be played on a grass court. White's mind in this game seems accustomed to overcaution. Inexplicably, White, in a kind of anti-frenzy, displays distinct signs of a cooling trend by agreeing to swap queens.</p>

<p>Black's queen, like all actresses, lives for an encore. In light of new developments, Black decides to reconsider his previous intent. But what I'm desperately attempting to understand is – what new developments? Black responds with counter-inexplicability! I have no idea why Black seeks to retain queens here, since with them off, his last headache (a possible white kingside attack) disappears. I would have swapped queens in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>When analysing a difficult position, the two mental states we should avoid are: laxity and overexcitement. With laxity, the mind sinks into a murky dullness of non-doing. With overexcitement, our mind jumps from this line to that one, impulsively, also without true focus. Strangely enough, White seems to be somewhat guilty of both in this game, switching between waiting (when he should have been attacking on the kingside) and taking action when he shouldn't (
