<h3>Why does White play Anti-Sicilian, rather than Open Sicilian?</h3>
<p>Bent Larsen once wrote that when White plays <b>3.d4</b> entering an Open Sicilian, he or she basically sets up a cheap series of tactical tricks in exchange for a serious concession: White just allowed <b>3...cxd4</b>, exchanging a wing pawn for White's more valuable central pawn.</p>
<p>When I was a hopelessly untalented kid, I began to play Najdorfs, hoping to be the next Bobby Fischer (no need to state the obvious, that it didn't work out as planned). Virtually 90% of my opponents responded to my 1...c5 with Open Sicilians, at least at my D-E level of play. As the years went by, this number continued to decrease, until today, I will bet that half the time you respond to
 <span onclick='loadMove("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1", this, "e2e4"); ' class="line0">1.e4</span>

, your opponents dodge the Open Sicilian, and opt for some version of an Anti-Sicilian. Now why would they do this? For several reasons:</p>
<p>1. We chess players live in a society of records and stored data. Make a new move – even accidentally – and somebody, somewhere, records it. These days new opening ideas travel almost instantly into the collective consciousness, laden with the latest and newest ideas. This can be a burden, since we are in a never-ending task of keeping up with the latest TN. Every time I manage to remember a long string of opening theory over the board, it reminds me of the end of the children's alphabet song: “Now I know my ABC's, next time won't you sing with me?” As the decades roll on, we face information overload.</p>
<p>If you play an Open Sicilian as White, there is a staggering load of data you must memorize and understand. If the opponent is a Dragon player, he or she obsessively studies the lines until move 23. Dragon players are far less likely to study the Grand Prix Attack or Closed Sicilian with the same degree of passion. So White is motivated to dodge our area of expertise. A substantial proportion of players decide they don't want to invest energy and time into a knife-edge Open Sicilian, a place where a favourite line can be rendered instantly obsolete by the finding of a single new idea for Black.</p>
<p>2. In an Open Sicilian, you as Black, get to pick if the game will be a Dragon, a Najdorf, a Kan, etc. When White plays the Anti-Sicilian, it is he or she who decides whether to play a King's Indian Attack, or c3-Sicilian.</p>
<p>3. If White studies, let's say the c3-Sicilian, there are only a few lines he needs to cover and study. Not so with Open Sicilians, where he must be ready for the Najdorf, Dragon, Kan, et al and ad nauseam! So in a sense, the Anti-Sicilians are kind of a lazy Sicilian, easy to study and easy to play – with far less likelihood for White to get theoretically ambushed.</p>
<p>4. When you first learn how to drive a car, every step must be thought about. A decade later, our driving is completely automatized (pun intended), and instinctual, where we can be daydreaming and still reach our destination in relative safety. Now if you play Dragon for 10 years, you just have a feel for it, from sheer volume of experience. Essentially, we become lab rats who memorized the route to the cheese. When White plays an Anti-Sicilian like a b3-Sicilian, it doesn't matter how long we as Black studied it. We simply won't know and understand its subtleties to the same degree as we do the Dragon. So White removes our experiential advantage – our feel for the line – from the equation.</p>
<h3>Handling the Anti-Sicilians</h3>
<p>A book is a theoretical entity, while our over-the-board battle is a direct experience of its practical application. Now how do we deal with these myriad Anti-Sicilian lines over the board? In high school, your writer was an unimpressive B – average student. In college my grades jumped to a near 4.0 (it would have been 4.0 if it hadn't been for the completely unnecessary, required math and science classes!). The difference? I finally learned that it's far better to continuously go over my study material very lightly – but all semester long – rather than cram, pulling an all-nighter, before the exam. So just do a study rotation of all your potential Anti-Sicilians, rather than just prepare for one line against a specific Anti-Sicilian opponent.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I browse an opening book, written in the 1980s or '90s, it feels as out of date as watching the 'news' from one of those black and white 1930s news reels, which warns of the danger of war brewing in Europe. The Anti-Sicilians, once mere offshoots, are now close to surpassing the old main lines of the Open Sicilian and every bit as mainstream. The Antis aren't going away, so we must be ready for all of them.</p>
<p>Some Anti lines may be both rigorous and exacting to our defensive abilities, yet our position's inherent soundness is never in doubt. I hope to explain the lines with only a minimal element of theoretical legalese in the process. In some variations, however, veering from observances of theory can spell immediate disaster for the unknowledgeable, or the experimenter, and theory sometimes hems in our imagination's freedom. Opening study is simultaneously the most tedious, as well as the most satisfying part of the game. So let's know our lines well. Our battlegrounds:</p>

<p>There is a big divide between learning and knowing. Here we find ourselves in both Rossolimo and Moscow variations, where we absolutely must learn our lines in detail, which isn't merely a pedant's pleasure. We must know and understand the plans, since our survival depends upon it.</p>

<p>Against Closed Sicilian systems, we play an early <b>...Rb8</b>, intending to make territorial gains on the queenside, while at the same time keeping our opponent guessing about how we will later set up on the kingside. Will we play <b>...e6</b> and <b>...Nge7</b>, or <b>...e5</b> and <b>...Nge7</b>, or <b>...Nf6</b>? Only we know, while our opponents can only guess.</p>

<p>The King's Indian Attack is a one crop society. If that single crop fails, so goes the society. I advocate a line which can also arise from the French Defence vs. KIA, where we remain flexible. We make White's intended e5 – a standard move in most KIAs – next to impossible to implement, since we may follow with <b>...Qc7</b> and <b>...f6</b>.</p>

<p>Grand Prix Attackers tend to have an unbounded propensity for violence. Unfortunately for them, modern day theory drains the attacking fun out of their line. In the 1960s and '70s almost everyone played their bishop to c4, hoping to generate an attack with <b>0-0</b>, <b>d3</b>, <b>Qe1</b>, <b>f5</b> and <b>Qh4</b>, with an ominous build-up around Black's king. Today, however, almost everyone knows the defensive mechanisms which render White's plan rather amateurish. Then later, White switches to the most positional <b>Bb5</b>. We respond with <b>...Nd4</b>, after which we either pick up the bishop pair, gain a future tempo with <b>...a6</b>, or chase the bishop to awkward squares like c4 or d3 – neither of which is comfortable for the bishop. So a highly feared attacking line of the past has been defanged in the present.</p>

<p>Sometimes reason, rationality and logic are asked to give way to imagination – but not without complaint. There is something in human nature where the larger the contradiction to reason, the more we seek to defy it. In this chapter the lure of attack extinguishes all other concerns. The Gambits chapter (Smith-Morra and Wing Gambit) differs from all the others, primarily in a level of intensity. If you think about it, isn't it strange to give away a pawn with the white pieces, when theory says a '+/=' is our natural birthright? I guess they want to bribe their way to the initiative. Of course, a positional player like me lacks the psychological metric for properly evaluating the alien mind state of the gambiteer, who doesn't strike me as a law abiding citizen of the chessboard.</p>
<p>To challenge and take on a single member of a cult, is to take them all on. When we accept the Smith-Morra Gambit, we do just that, walking into the lair of preparation, with the single consoling thought: the gambit may only be borderline sound (I realize this statement will earn me the undying hatred of Smith-Morra Gambiteers worldwide). The mad scientist's dream is to build a machine or a creature which thinks, feels and speaks. Of course, the second it's built, it turns evil and tries to destroy its creator. We must take on the role of the creature when facing these gambits, turning their power against White, their creator.</p>

<p>To declare such a gambit refuted, is to make excessive demands upon the reader's trust. This is the Wing Gambit (well, when you were young, didn't you sometimes hang out with disreputable friends?). It's time to enter never-never land, where White mixes ideas seen in both the Evans and Benko gambits. Gambiteers – they are essentially martyrs in search of a religion – defend the soundness of their lines, as vigorously as Clarence Darrow defended Darwin's theories in the Scopes trial.</p>
<p>One of my misguided students loves the Wing Gambit. I advise him: "Dump it. It doesn't love you back!" Of course, he doesn't believe me, since gambits are dopamine surges for the attacking addict. I think the Wing Gambit – more than the Smith-Morra – is an opening where the effort and cash outlay aren't commensurate with White's investment's return. For younger players though, I think gambits are fun and a good way to circumvent the theoretical legal process, and just go after the opponent in vigilante-style.</p>

<h3>Anti-Sicilians are not new</h3>
<p>They have been around, about as long as Open Sicilians, as shown in the following game:</p>

</p>
<p>When it comes to opening theory, there is no such thing as an unalterable truth. That which is old and discarded is in the present, new again. The b3-Sicilian is gaining ground in popularity, mainly through the advocacy of super-GMs like Kramnik, Morozevich and Carlsen. The inherent problem with blindly following the dictates of complex theoretical lines is that we abandon our own research, and rely upon others to form our convictions. So players today seek less booked up alternatives (to the Open Sicilian), like the b3-Sicilian.</p>
<p>As you can see, Anti-Sicilians have been around for quite a while. A fianchetto was a strange sight in 1921, unless you were a card-carrying member of the Hypermodern movement, as Breyer was. In this instance his opponent beats him to it. The b3-Sicilian is an odd mix of Classical and Hypermodern theories, where White both seeks to occupy the centre with e4, and also control it from the wings with

<p>An ambitious opponent is easy to bait. The nature of an unwise decision is the current joy we experience in chasing a folly, is met with our future pain, when the effects of our decision ripen. Saleable goods are worthless if they are unable to reach the market. White's 'attack' never emerges, despite his open h-file. To change one's mind if the data calls for it is not such a great transgression; to change one's mind based on an arbitrary whim, is. White's counterplay, already late, just got later.</p>
