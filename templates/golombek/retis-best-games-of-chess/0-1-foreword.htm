<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
<p>Chess, like literature and the arts, often suffers a premature loss. The poems that Keats and Shelley might have written, the music that Mozart and Schubert might have composed, these have their counterparts in the missing games due to the early deaths of such masters as Charousek, Breyer and Réti. Fortunately for us, however, just as the poets and composers managed to pack into their brief life an abundance of poetry and music so these chess masters produced a wealth of wonderful games. Réti had a chess-playing career of about twenty years during which he played in many more tournaments than most masters with a normal span of life. The present collection contains a balanced selection from all the phases of his life and an attempt has been made to illustrate the high quality of his endgame studies, showing the development in their style by placing them in chronological order throughout the book.</p>
<p>I have many acknowledgments to make for help rendered in my researches into Réti's life, games and studies. Firstly, to Réti himself on whose writings and notes I have drawn liberally. Next, to the contemporaries of Réti, such as Spielmann, Kmoch, Grünfeld and Tartakower — especially the last-named, not only for his writings, but also for many verbal communications. In my study of Réti's endgame compositions I was much indebted to the authoritative work on them by Dr. Mandler, published in Czechoslovakia at Mährisch-Ostrau in 1931. I am also very grateful to Mr. E. G. R. Cordingley, who kindly supplemented my books with his own spacious library and I owe much to the following for assisting me in researches into Réti's career in their various countries: Dr. G. Barcza for Réti in Hungary, the Czechoslovak Chess Federation for its aid as regards the later period in Czechoslovakia, Dr. Niemeyer for Holland and the late Roberto Grau for generously showing me a game he had lost to Réti in Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>Finally, I should like to give my grateful thanks to Richard Réti's brother, Mr. Rudolf Réti, for his most kind encouragement and indeed active interest in my work. In a recent letter to me he has defined to perfection the essential aim of Richard Réti in chess: 'Though not an advanced chess player myself (being a writer and musician by profession), my brother often discussed with me his ideas on chess and in particular his inner relationship to chess as an art. And, as you know, he was always more interested in the creative aspects of this Art of Chess than in merely winning the game. '</p>
