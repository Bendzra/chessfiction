<h2>MEMOIR OF RÉTI</h2>
<p>Richard Réti was born at Pezzinok near Bratislava (then known as Pressburg) on May 28th, 1889. It would be as well to clear up the vexed question of his nationality here, a question that was bedevilled by the Treaty of Trianon at the end of the First World War. Pezzinok was situated in Hungary, so that Réti (who came of Jewish stock, like practically all the other contemporary leaders and pioneers of the hypermodern school of chess — Breyer, Nimzowitsch, Tartakower, etc. ) was born a citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. By the Treaty of Trianon, however, this part of Hungary was assigned to Czechoslovakia and Ret became Czech by nationality and played for that country in subsequent internatianal team tournaments.</p>
<p>To make confusion worse confounded, Réti was generally regarded as a typical product of the Viennese school. For he was sent to study mathematics at Vienna University, and the schooling he obtained there together with the still more important acquaintances and friends he made formed his character and vitally influenced the rest of his life. In his youth for some time mathematics and chess equally absorbed him but eventually the latter gained the upper hand since, and I here quote his own words, 'paradoxically enough I considered chess more alive than mathematics'. He goes on to explain that the comparison was between modern mathematics of a purely speculative character and the over the board struggle in chess where he could force his opponent to acknowledge the truth of his chess ideas.</p>
<p>From his earliest years it was clear that he was a talented player; but what was not at first quite so clear was whether he would cross the gap that separates the talented amateur from the great master player. In the Hungarian National tournament at Székesfehérvár in 1907 he occupied the modest position of equal seventh out of fifteen, and in the next year he did rather worse in coming fourth out of seven at Prague. Still more unpromising, in fact directly damning, was his first essay in international chess when he came firmly bottom in a big tournament at Vienna in 1908. It was little consolation to find a contemporary journalist writing about him that '11/2 points was quite creditable for a young amateur, and in any case Mr. Réti had only gallantly stepped in at the last moment to fill the place of a missing master'. Note the 'Mr,' — nothing more galling for the aspiring young player than this appellation.</p>
<!--p>2</p><p>RTI'S BEST GAMES OF CHESS</p-->
<p>But now there came a sudden increase in his chess strength. Réti was afterwards to attribute this to his friendship with Julius Breyer, and it is obvious that his ideas and play were greatly influenced by Breyer, an iconoclast in the world of chess who was not content with shattering the old idols in effigy, but destroyed them at the chess-board, where he met and defeated many of the leading masters of the classical school in his short life (he died still younger than Réti). Equally clearly, Réti was exercising generosity in ascribing his advance as so completely due to Breyer's inspiration. Probably the truth is that each young player influenced the other in almost interminable discussion of chess ideas during their walks along the banks of the Danube.</p>
<p>He became increasingly successful in strong local tournaments in Vienna, where he was more and more noted for the brilliance of his combinative ideas, an impression that was confirmed by his fine showing in the international gambit tournament at Abbazia (now known as Opatija) in 1912. The outbreak of the First World War found him doing very well indeed in the great unfinished international tournament at Mannheim. But for the next four years international chess was non-existent.</p>
<p>The interval seems to have had a most salutary effect on his chess ideas and strength, for in 1918 he burst upon the world with a bang as a great player when he won first prize at Kaschau (Kassa) in a field that included Vidmar, Breyer, Asztalos, Havasi and Mieses. He shared first prize at Budapest in the same year, was first at Rotterdam, 1919, Amsterdam and Vienna, 1920, and, above all, won first prize at the great international tournament of Gothenburg, 1920 — the first tournament after the war to deserve these adjectives.</p>
<p>In 1921 he was less active as a player for by now he had fallen victim to a disease that is often fatal to a chess master — he had become a chess journalist and author. He was a regular columnist in the Austrian and German newspapers, and the world's loss in tournament games was transmuted into a gain in ideas, for from this source sprang Réti's great book Die neun Ideen im Schachspiel. The irritation that produced this pearl has now been quite forgotten. One Franz Gutmayer wrote a number of books on the game without knowing very much or understanding anything about chess. Enraged at his incompetence and provoked at his impertinence in not only claiming to be able to teach the way to chess mastery, but also professing to explain the great masters of the past and present (Réti said of him 'this Gutmayer who might perhaps in fifty years' time be so far advanced as to comprehend Steinitz and has at present achieved this much at least — a partial understanding of Morphy'), Réti wrote a set of articles showing the false shallowness of Gutmayer's writings. But in order to
<!--p>MEMOIR OF RÉTI</p><p>3</p-->
demonstrate this he found it necessary to describe and explain what the great masters were and what was the essential nature of their ideas. This was the stuff of his book, a small one of 121 pages that, despite its modest appearance, was to have an important and decisive effect on chess theory. A year later an English edition appeared under the title of Modern Ideas in Chess. This was both larger and better than its German predecessor since Réti had expunged a certain amount of topical matter (including the unfortunate Gutmayer) and added much valuable material.</p>
<p>With this book out of his system, Réti returned to the chess arena and participated in practically all the great tournaments of his day. In 1922 he was equal first at Teplitz-Schönau; in 1923 he was twice second at two important tournaments — at Mährisch-Ostrau and Vienna; whilst in 1924 he achieved his famous win over Capablanca in the great New York tournament. From here he went to South America, where he made a prolonged stay. It was during this visit that he established a new world blindfold simultaneous record: at Sao Paulo in Brazil, where he won 20 games, drew 7 and lost 2 on February 7th, 1925. For, throughout his life he was a wonderful blindfold player, and there existed a friendly rivalry between him and Alekhine on this point. Dr. Tartakower relates an amusing incident with reference to this in that mine of information and wit, The Hypermodern Game of Chess. At London, 1922, Alekhine and Réti were indulging in some blindfold analysis and had apparently come to a full stop of disagreement on a position. Whereupon Alekhine said: 'Since we are, of course, the two best blindfold players in the world, I think it would be better if we had recourse to a chessboard and men. '</p>
<p>In 1925 he returned to Europe, but for some time his results were disappointingly below those attained in the years immediately after the war. Perhaps an excess of journalism was one of the main causes for this comparative decline. However, his seventh place out of twenty-one in the great Moscow tournament of 1925 was respectable enough, and from this tournament, as Kmoch says in the Wiener Schachzeitung for 1926, he not only brought back a 'beauty prize' for his game against Romanowski, but also a beautiful young Russian as wife.</p>
<p>From now on he was actively engaged in creating his famous endgame studies which include in their number (alas! too few, his total production being little more than fifty) some of the finest ever composed. Tartakower quotes Réti as saying that 'the whole of chess can be viewed merely as an endgame study on the grand scale', and his studies have the twofold virtues of great artistry and outstanding practical use for the game itself.</p>
<!--p>4</p><p>RTI'S BEST GAMES OF CHESS</p-->
<p>With the year 1927 Réti commenced to climb back to his better form and his true place as a great master. At Bad Homburg he was second, and he scored very well on top board for Czechoslovakia in the International Team Tournament at London. Still better were his results in 1928, when he obtained two firsts at Vienna and Giessen, a second at Dortmund and an equal first at Brno. Towards the end of the year he went to Scandinavia, where he made a prolonged tour. His last tournament was at Stockholm, a double-round affair from December 23rd, 1928, to January 30th, 1929. The final scores were Réti 4½, Lundin and Stoltz 3, and Stahlberg 1½.</p>
<p>Returning from Scandinavia after a tour of simultaneous displays in Sweden and Norway, he busied himself with the preparation for the press of his next great book, Masters of the Chess Board; but he was not to live to complete it. He fell ill with scarlet fever and died in a Prague hospital on June 6th, 1929, at the age of forty.</p>
<p>The above outlines Réti's chess career; but it gives only a partial picture of the man himself. Genial and friendly, witty without malice, he was, as a French acquaintance put it, 'jovial et bon enfant'. He was not just a chess master and a chess author, but a poetic and intellectual artist who happened to have chosen chess as the medium for his ideas. For the sake of the idea, he was willing to give up success, not only as it is known to the outer world away from chess, but even to chess players themselves in the form of tournament or match triumphs. This idealism too rendered him a proverb of forgetfulness amongst his friends and acquaintances. To quote Tartakower again: 'He forgot everything, stick, hat, umbrella; above all, however, he would always leave behind him his traditional yellow leather briefcase, so that it was said of him: wherever Réti's briefcase is, there he himself is no longer to be found. It is therefore evidence of Réti's pre-existence. '</p>
<p>In chess itself his abiding passion was strategy, and it was here that he made his greatest contribution to the chess world. Spielmann, in his obituary of Réti in L'Echiquier for 1929, says of him: 'Perhaps his strength did not reside so much in the discovery of a new move or of a tactical finesse hitherto unknown as in a new strategy. Very frequently and only after a few moves, I would find myself settling down against him with a lost position without knowing exactly how it could possibly have happened. '</p>
<p>Réti won many brilliancy prizes throughout his life, but even in the short period that this comprises the nature of these brilliancies evolved from the early blood-and-thunder type to something of great subtlety and beauty — so much so that one feels the term 'beauty prize' to be much more appropriate to the awards gained by him during the last ten years of his career. A significant light on his
<!--p>MEMOIR OF RÉTI</p><p>5</p-->
views in this matter is thrown by the following extract of an article Réti wrote in an edition of the Morgenzeitung, 1929. He was annotating a game from Russia in which the adjoined position was reached.</p>

, was played, and Réti remarks: 'Something ike this is not only pretty, but has also the advantage of being much easier to understand than a difficult positional game. Thus it is only natural that the greater part of the chess world should be displeased with the fact that one seldom sees anything similar happening in modern master tournaments. But the blame should be laid, not on the masters, but on the tournament organisers. The latter must decide to invite to great-master tournaments some Pobedins as well. Then the public would see so many sacrificial combinations of this type that they would soon find them as banal and uninteresting as the writer of these lines — please forgive me for this confession — finds this Queen sacrifice'.</p>
<p>I leave the last word with Réti; his games follow to prove them and show where true beauty lies.</p>
